PAK vs ENG: Ahmed recalled as England picks spin-heavy team for third test against Pakistan,"Published : Oct 22, 2024 14:49 IST , RAWALPINDI - 1 MIN READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE READ LATER Rehan Ahmed of England in bowling during nets ahead of the 3rd Test Match between Pakistan and England at Rawalpindi. | Photo Credit: STU FORSTER/Getty Images England has included three spinners in its team for its third and final test match against Pakistan in Rawalpindi, with Rehan Ahmed being recalled, the England and Wales cricket board (ECB) said on Tuesday. England won the first test by an innings and 47 runs, before Pakistan levelled the series with a 152-run victory in Multan on a surface that offered plenty of turn - with spin duo Noman Ali and Sajid Khan taking all 20 wickets. Pakistan is expected to create a similar pitch for the final test match and Ahmed will feature alongside fellow spinners Shoaib Bashir and Jack Leach, while fast bowler Gus Atkinson was also brought in.

Ahmed, 20, played his first test match in 2022 during England’s tour of Pakistan, taking a five-wicket haul on his debut as the visitors completed a 3-0 sweep of the series. “He’s an outstanding cricketer. It’s not just his bowling, but his batting and fielding. He’s a young lad so he has a lot of time to come,” Brook said. “He got five-for in the last test here, so hopefully he can do that again.” England quicks Brydon Carse and Matthew Potts miss out.

Channapatna bypolls: BJP leader C.P. Yogeshwar resigns as MLC over not getting party ticket,"Updated - October 22, 2024 10:00 am IST - Belagavi/Bengaluru BJP leader C.P. Yogeshwar (right) handing over his resignation letter as MLC to Legislative Council Chairman in Hubballi on Monday. | Photo Credit: KIRAN BAKALE BJP leader C.P. Yogeshwar (right) handing over his resignation letter as MLC to Legislative Council Chairman in Hubballi on Monday. | Photo Credit: KIRAN BAKALE The bypolls to the Channapatna Assembly seat got complicated for the National Democratic Alliance on Monday with cine actor-turned-BJP leader and ticket aspirant C.P. Yogeshwar resigning as BJP MLC after it turned out that he would not get the party ticket. Though Mr. Yogeshwar, a former Minister, told presspersons after submitting his resignation that he was planning to contest as an Independent, speculation is rife that he is in touch with the ruling Congress too. His decision to quit as MLC and his reputation of being a party hopper has added to speculations. Keeping everyone guessing, Mr. Yogeshwar, who has represented Channapatna in the Assembly multiple times, said he would take two days to decide on his future course of action. While the BJP has left the seat to its alliance partner Janata Dal (S), Mr. Yogeshwar refused to contest on JD (S) ticket, saying even now he was willing to contest but only on the BJP ticket. Mr. Yogeshwar flew down to Hubballi to meet Legislative Council Chairman Basavaraj Horatti at his home office to submit the resignation. “I have not been assured of the party [BJP] ticket. Then, I was given the offer of fighting on a JD(S) ticket. But I rejected it as I want to contest on BJP ticket given my seniority in the party. The BJP district president told me that the party wanted to field Nikhil Kumaraswamy as the JD(S) candidate from Channapatna. I wished them luck and came to Hubballi,” he said. The NDA leaders have left the Channapatna seat to JD(S) as its leader H.D. Kumaraswamy held the seat before entering the Lok Sabha. However, considering the present political situation in which Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar himself is personally monitoring the Congress’ bypoll preparations in the constituency, NDA leaders had decided to ask Mr. Yogeshwar to contest on JD(S) ticket. His future political moves are being closely watched as any division of votes in Channapatna may turn the bypoll into a challenge for the JD(S), which is considering the possibility of fielding Mr. Nikhil Kumaraswamy. D.K. Suresh, former MP for Bengaluru Rural and brother of Mr. Shivakumar, too, disclosed on Sunday that there was pressure on him to contest from Channapatna. Of the three Assembly seats that are going to the polls in Karnataka, the Channapatna seat has hogged attention as it has turned out to be a prestige battle between two Vokkaliga heavyweights — Union Minister Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Shivakumar. In fact, Mr. Yogeshwar’s rebellion is also speculated to be linked to this turf battle between the two political leaders. Mr. Shivakumar, who was crestfallen after his brother lost the Lok Sabha polls from Bengaluru Rural and the party lost most of the seats in the Vokkaliga belt, is keen to redeem the pride by ensuring a Congress victory in Channapatna. At the same time, Mr. Kumaraswamy is determined to send a message that his hold in the region cannot be challenged. It is particularly important for him as his son Mr. Nikhil Kumaraswamy is a front runner. Meanwhile, seeking to downplay the differences, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, R. Ashok, said: “Yogeshwar will not take any hasty decision. Since it is a JD (S) seat, we need to go by their advice.” Published - October 21, 2024 06:08 pm IST Karnataka / Bangalore / state politics Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Ronaldo and Al-Nassr’s ACL game moved to Dubai amid Iran security fears,"Published : Oct 21, 2024 11:20 IST - 3 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr Cristiano Ronaldo reacts in a match with Iran’s Persepolis during their AFC Champions League match. (File Photo) | Photo Credit: AP Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr’s AFC Champions League Elite game with Esteghlal of Tehran on Tuesday will be as closely watched in India as it is in Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said in a statement released last Tuesday that Esteghlal had to move its home fixture with Al-Nassr to the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai due to the security situation in Iran. The decision was greeted by surprise in India as, on October 7, the AFC ruled that Mohun Bagan Super Giants of Kolkata had been “considered to have withdrawn” from the second tier AFC Champions League Two for refusing to travel to Iran to play its October 2 fixture against Tractor SC in the northwestern city of Tabriz. It is not only Al-Nassr’s game that has been relocated. Tractor’s home game against Ravshan of Tajikistan, scheduled for Wednesday, has been switched to become an away tie. Iran’s national team also had to move its Oct. 15 World Cup qualifier against Qatar to Dubai. “...(Mohun Bagan) notes that the AFC has indeed recognised the volatility of the situation in Iran and as such, has rescheduled or shifted venues for several games,” a spokesperson for Mohun Bagan told Associated Press, adding that the confederation had taken the same geopolitical instability into account that the club had. “Failing to apply the same standard to Mohun Bagan would result in unequal treatment by the AFC.” According to the spokesperson, Mohun Bagan had made a request to the AFC that the game’s date or venue be changed before it decided not to travel. READ | La Liga 2024-25: Lewandowski extends scoring streak as Barcelona routs Sevilla 5-1 “We consistently communicated concerns about the volatile and unsafe conditions in and around Iran, particularly regarding the safety of players and staff,” the official added. The Indian Super League club said that it had appealed the decision to the relevant AFC committee and hoped to be reinstated into the tournament. The AFC did not reply to an invitation to comment. Al-Nassr has four points from the first two games and can take a big step towards the second round with a win. The revamped tournament now consists of two groups of 12 — divided into west and east geographic zones — with the top eight from each advancing to the Round of 16. Nassr is going well in the Saudi Pro League with a 97th minute penalty from Ronaldo giving the team a 2-1 win over Al-Shabab on Friday to stay in third place. “There are a lot of games at the moment and it is not easy,” said Stefano Pioli, Al-Nassr’s coach. “We will do our best to maintain our performances in the Asian Champions League.” Saudi Arabia has three of the four top teams in Group A. Al-Hilal is first and the four-time winner meets defending champion Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates and could welcome Neymar back to action after a year out through injury. Jeddah club Al-Ahli also has maximum points and travels to Qatar to face Al-Rayyan. In the eastern zone the top two meet. Gwangju FC of South Korea is making its first ever appearance in Asian competition and is the only team with two wins from two. It takes on Johor Darul Ta’zim of Malaysia. Australia’s Central Coast Mariners has lost both games so far and head to China to take on Shanghai Port, coached by former Australian international Kevin Muscat, also seeking a first win. Last season’s defeated finalist Yokohama F. Marinos also travels to China and meets Shandong Tiashan while three-time winner Pohang Steelers of South Korea faces Thailand’s Buriram United.

R.G. Kar case: Protesting junior doctors call off hunger strike after meeting Mamata,"Updated - October 22, 2024 06:28 am IST - KOLKATA Junior doctors address the media before they leave for Nabanna for a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, at the site of their hunger strike in Kolkata on October 21, 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI The West Bengal Junior Doctors’ Front decided to call off their hunger strike on Monday (October 21, 2024) after a two-hour-long meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee earlier in the day. The resident doctors have been on a fast-unto-death at Esplanade in the heart of Kolkata since October 5. More than half a dozen of the doctors had to be hospitalised from the protest site after their health deteriorated. The development assumes significance as Ms. Banerjee had for the past few days asked the doctors to withdraw their hunger strike and come to the discussion table. The 31-year-old rape and murder victim’s parents had reached the indefinite hunger strike stage in support of her colleagues who are protesting to ask for justice. The victim’s parents said that they do not want to tragically lose another child like their own to this hunger strike. Follow LIVE updates from the meeting between protesting junior doctors and Bengal CM The doctors said that many factions of civil society have also requested them to lift the hunger strike and keep fighting for their demands in other ways. Debasish Haldar, speaking on behalf of the junior doctors, said: “Respecting the victim’s parents request and the multiple requests made by the civil society, we are withdrawing the indefinite hunger strike. We have also decided to drop our plans to cease all medical services from tomorrow, October 22, which we had previously called for.” While breaking the fast, Rumelika Kumar, a fasting doctor, said: “We are solely lifting the fast on request of Abhaya’s parents and the civil society’s urges. We are not doing it because of the government’s requests or we are intimidated by them.” Ms. Banerjee had said during the meeting that it is the doctors’ democratic right to protest. She added, “I urge you to lift the protests and fast as soon as possible. I ask for reports about your well-being every hour. You tell me what you want not once, but ten times if you want. But please lift the strike.” A few hours after the meeting, the junior doctors responded to the discussions in the meeting and said that they are lifting the hunger strike. Dr. Haldar said that the authorities may have given some positive responses verbally, but their body language was not welcoming or inclusive in any way. Dr. Haldar said, “We were not allowed to wear our ‘We want justice’ badge inside the meeting.” Junior doctors further stated that they do not know if the assurances that the government gave today were only to dismiss them and dilute their movement or they had any basis of reality which they will live up to. Protesting junior doctors in Kolkata met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna (State Secretariat) to discuss their 10-point charter of demands. The meeting came out with a resolution to set up and elect a task force by March 2025. The doctors and the Chief Minister held a two-hour long discussion as their colleagues continued their 17-day long indefinite hunger strike in the heart of Kolkata. In a first, the meeting was live telecast on television from the State Secretariat in the presence of multiple stakeholders. There were various moments during the meeting when the Chief Minister was interjected by the stakeholders. Chief Secretary Manoj Pant had asked for only 10 doctors to be present at the meeting, but 17 doctors participated. Multiple other stakeholders were also present at the meeting, including Medical Superintendents cum Vice-Principals (MSVPs) from five medical colleges and college principals, along with senior doctors. Before going to the meeting, the doctors held a public meeting and reiterated that they will not back out from the strike if concrete steps are not taken by the government during the talks. Mr. Pant said that they have formed an interim State-level task force and grievance committee which can be accessed by all medical professional stakeholders so they can share their issues. “The different committees where you seek representation will be possible only when they are elected bodies. We let you know in writing that we will initiate processes to ensure medical college-level elections are held by March 2025, after exams are completed,” the Chief Secretary said. Ms. Banerjee agreed with the protesting junior resident doctors’ grievance about removing and reducing threat culture in the State-run hospitals. “You need to be free of threat culture. Just because I am in power, I threaten someone, or someone threatens someone because they are in power. This cannot happen. No one can threaten anyone,” she said. The CM further stated that peace should be restored through an elected grievance body. She said that medical bodies and councils can only be changed through an election process and there are rules set in place for it. They are autonomous bodies and no one can change that without due process, she added. She further said that it is not possible to meet all demands in one day as it needs sufficient time. She also assured that they will perform capacity building in hospitals as per the economic capacity of the State. COMMENT: The battle cry for justice in the ‘City of Joy’ Mr. Pant said the State government has already started a central referral system as a pilot project. He requested the doctors to send suggestions about operating this system smoothly and expressed hope that it could be scaled up from November 1. They also promised to share a written directive by 3 p.m. on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) about the doctors’ demands. The written directive was one of the top demands put forth by the doctors. Before going to the meeting, the doctors had said that they demand the removal of Health Secretary N.S. Nigam from his post as they had seen several documents that showed evidence of corruption in medical institutions and were approved by the Principal Health Secretary. But the CM said that one cannot accuse anyone of being a suspect until it is proved. The last meeting between the Ms. Banerjee and doctors took place on September 16 at the CM’s residence after which the doctors had revoked their cease work protest and sit-in demonstrations. On Saturday (October 26, 2024), they are set to hold a mass convention at the R.G. Kar Medical College in the city.

Supriya Sule slams ruling Shiv Sena for ‘temporarily’ removing Gauri Lankesh murder accused,"Published - October 21, 2024 09:40 pm IST - MUMBAI NCP(SP) leader Supriya Sule in Mumbai on October 13, 2024 | Photo Credit: PTI NCP (Sharad Pawar) MP Supriya Sule on Monday (October 21, 2024) alleged that the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra had temporarily “removed” an individual accused in the Gauri Lankesh murder case from the party only for the duration of the upcoming Assembly election. Amid growing backlash, the Shiv Sena, led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, announced on Sunday (October 20, 2024) that it had stayed the appointment of the accused, Shrikant Pangarkar, to any position in the party’s Jalna district unit. Mr. Pangarkar, who had been granted bail by the Karnataka High Court in September, joined the Shiv Sena last Friday in the presence of senior leader and former Minister Arjun Khotkar, ahead of polls. A Shiv Sena statement on Sunday (October 20, 2024) clarified that if Mr. Pangarkar had been given any party post in Jalna, then it would be put on hold. However, Ms. Sule criticised the move, saying that the action was merely for show during the election period. “An accused in the Gauri Lankesh murder case was inducted into the party and has now been removed. But this is not enough. The façade of morality is only for the election period. After the polls, such goons will be welcomed back,” she tweeted on ‘X’. Gauri Lankesh, a journalist, was shot dead outside her Bengaluru home on September 5, 2017. A police investigation, with the support of agencies from Maharashtra, led to multiple arrests. Mr. Pangarkar, a former Jalna municipal councillor for the undivided Shiv Sena (2001-2006), was arrested in August 2018, and Karnataka High Court granted him bail on September 4 this year.

The terrorists had opened fire on a camp housing workers of a private company, who were working on an under-construction Z-Mohr tunnel in the Gund area, which connects Gaganeer to Sonamarg in Central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district. The police and army have cordoned off the area to track the attackers. The Z-Mohr tunnel is strategically important for defence. The tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to people and the Indian Army in Ladakh. Heavy snowfall at Zojila often cuts off Ladakh from Kashmir. This disrupts the movement of forces, people and essential goods and services. Security personnel from the Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) along with local police officials have cordoned off the area. Teams from the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the premier agency that investigates terror attacks, have also rushed to the spot. #Terror incident in Gagangeer, #Ganderbal.

The CRPF school in Delhi’s Rohini as already witnessed a blast, which remains a mystery as the accused are at large. According to the sources, in the fresh mail sent late on Monday night, the accused has said, “Due to the impact created by the recent arrest of Mr Jaffer Sadiq of DMK in the meth case, international pressure has mounted. Thus, leading to the Tamil Nadu Police intelligence getting highly polarised with the internal DMK family matters. Hence such blasts in/near Central(Union) Government schools are necessary to divert the attention away from the MK Stalin family’s involvement in the case.” “Benami of MK Stalin, Mr Arjundurai Rajasankar and his wife Mrs Narmada Rathnakumar Nadar have been made pawns with ED coming for their nearest and dearest. Hence, such whistle-blowing is necessary. Act soon,” the sender, who identified himself as Kiruthiga Devdiya, said.

The dcblore@ksp.gov.in account has and is suppressing vital intel, and shall bear witness to the next week’s happenings,” the mail has said. The Delhi Police on Monday said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to a blast at the CRPF school in Rohini’s Prashant Vihar area. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform. The purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents.

Salman Khan Hits Pause on Sikandar Shoot Due To Death Threats From Lawrence Bishnoi? Here's the Truth,"Curated By: Dishya Sharma News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 12:36 IST Mumbai, India Salman Khan began filming for his Eid 2025 film release, Sikandar, a few weeks ago. It seems like Salman Khan’s work is taking a massive hit due to the ongoing security concerns and death threats from gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Over the weekend, Salman looked mentally affected by the threats and Baba Siddique’s death while appearing on Bigg Boss 18 Weekend Ka Vaar. Soon after, it was reported that Rohit Shetty allegedly dropped the idea of shooting his Chulbul Pandey cameo for Singham Again owing to Salman’s distressing time. Now, it is claimed that Sikandar’s shooting schedule has also come to a standstill. However, a source told News18 Showsha that it is not the case. A source close to Salman Khan claimed that Salman is limiting his work commitments to lay low amid the growing death threats he’s been subjected to. “It is no longer enough to provide him stern security. For some time now, Salman would have to lie really now. He won’t be shooting for anything for quite a while, indefinitely I’d say,” the actor’s alleged close friend told Times Now. “Abhi kuch nahin kaha jaa sakta hai. Sikandar requires a whole lot of choreographed action. Director Murugadoss needed Salman’s full attention. But right now that seems impossible. The way ahead is still very unclear. Right now, the most important thing is Salman and his family’s safety. That won’t be compromised under any circumstance,” the insider added. Salman and his team are yet to react to the claims. A source has informed News18 Showsha that Salman is returning to the sets of Sikandar today. “Salman Khan is set to begin shooting today for his role as Sikander,” the insider said. Directed by A.R. Murugadoss and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, Sikandar is set to release on Eid 2025. The film has been in the making for a few months now. Rashmika Mandanna and Kajal Aggarwal, who are playing pivotal parts in the film, had confirmed that the shoot had commenced via social media posts. Meanwhile, a few weeks ago, it was reported that Salman had injured himself on the sets of the film. The Bollywood star had confirmed that he had injured his ribs during the filming process. However, in the recent days, Salman has been tackling death threats from members of the Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang. The most recent threat came shortly after Mumbai-based political leader Baba Siddique’s murder. The leader, who was close to Salman, was shot outside his son’s office and died in the hospital shortly after. Salman’s security has been amped up ever since.",Curated By Dishya Sharma News18com Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 1236 IST Mumbai India Salman Khan began filming for his Eid 2025 film release Sikandar a few weeks ago It seems like Salman Khans work is taking a massive hit due to the ongoing security concerns and death threats from gangster Lawrence Bishnoi Over the weekend Salman looked mentally affected by the threats and Baba Siddiques death while appearing on Bigg Boss 18 Weekend Ka Vaar Soon after it was reported that Rohit Shetty allegedly dropped the idea of shooting his Chulbul Pandey cameo for Singham Again owing to Salmans distressing time Now it is claimed that Sikandars shooting schedule has also come to a standstill However a source told News18 Showsha that it is not the case A source close to Salman Khan claimed that Salman is limiting his work commitments to lay low amid the growing death threats hes been subjected to It is no longer enough to provide him stern security For some time now Salman would have to lie really now He wont be shooting for anything for quite a while indefinitely Id say the actors alleged close friend told Times Now Abhi kuch nahin kaha jaa sakta hai Sikandar requires a whole lot of choreographed action Director Murugadoss needed Salmans full attention But right now that seems impossible The way ahead is still very unclear Right now the most important thing is Salman and his familys safety That wont be compromised under any circumstance the insider added Salman and his team are yet to react to the claims A source has informed News18 Showsha that Salman is returning to the sets of Sikandar today Salman Khan is set to begin shooting today for his role as Sikander the insider said Directed by AR Murugadoss and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala Sikandar is set to release on Eid 2025 The film has been in the making for a few months now Rashmika Mandanna and Kajal Aggarwal who are playing pivotal parts in the film had confirmed that the shoot had commenced via social media posts Meanwhile a few weeks ago it was reported that Salman had injured himself on the sets of the film The Bollywood star had confirmed that he had injured his ribs during the filming process However in the recent days Salman has been tackling death threats from members of the Lawrence Bishnois gang The most recent threat came shortly after Mumbaibased political leader Baba Siddiques murder The leader who was close to Salman was shot outside his sons office and died in the hospital shortly after Salmans security has been amped up ever since,Toxic
"Wayanad bypoll: Have more experience as people's rep than Priyanka Gandhi , says BJP's Navya Haridas","Published - October 22, 2024 04:59 pm IST - Wayanad BJP’s Navya Haridas. File | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement In Wayanad's 3-way electoral contest, BJP's Navya Haridas is banking on her political experience to take on Congress' Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the November 13 bypoll, which also will be the AICC general secretary's maiden electoral fight. A software engineer with international experience in Singapore and the Netherlands, and a decade as a councillor in Kozhikode, Ms. Haridas is confident her background equips her to challenge Ms. Vadra, who is keen to extend the Congress' winning streak in this hilly Lok Sabha segment vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi. Ms. Haridas told PTI in an interview on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) that although Ms. Vadra holds a position in the AICC, she lacks experience as a people's representative. Also Read: U.P. Congress welcomes Rahul Gandhi’s decision to retain Rae Bareli  ""Priyanka Gandhi is a national figure due to her Nehru family background, but this is her first election. I, on the other hand, have served as a councillor in the Kozhikode Corporation for two consecutive terms and contested the 2021 Assembly elections."" ""I have been representing the people for many years, so contesting against Priyanka Gandhi doesn't feel any different to me. I believe I have more experience than she does,"" the BJP candidate said, a day ahead of the Congress leader's entry into Wayanad, where she is seeking votes with a roadshow in Kalpetta. The by-election for the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency was necessitated after Rahul Gandhi vacated it following his victory in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Eminent CPI leader and former MLA, Sathyan Mokeri, is contesting on the CPIM-led ruling LDF ticket. ""The fight is only between Congress and BJP. See, this election was necessitated due to the irresponsibility of Congress. In many parts of Wayanad, you still see flex boards asking for votes for Rahul Gandhi. However, he chose to keep the Rae Bareli seat and handed Wayanad over to his sister. This is an example of family dominance, and the BJP will highlight this issue before the voters,"" Ms. Haridas said. Navya, who is also the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha, BJP's women's wing, believes PM Narendra Modi's development agenda will work in favour of the party in Wayanad. ""BJP always puts forward the agenda of development. There has been no intervention from the people's representatives in the issues demanded by the people here for the past several years."" She said Wayanad is not a constituency where the BJP has a strong organisational foothold but pointed out at its electoral gains. ""However, the party's vote share doubled compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Moreover, we saw that people voted for the BJP in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, and it showed that people want the BJP in power. We expect that kind of change will happen here also,"" she said. In the 2024 elections, the BJP saw its vote share in Wayanad rise to 5.75 per cent, when its state president K Surendran took on Rahul Gandhi. The NDA candidate secured 1,41,045 votes, a significant increase from the 78,816 votes in 2019 when the seat was contested by BDJS, an NDA ally. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi's victory margin decreased to 3,64,422, down from the 4,31,770 votes polled in 2019. Ms. Haridas, an engineering graduate, entered politics almost by accident. After earning her B.Tech degree, she worked as a software professional. In 2009, she married marine engineer Shobin Shyam and moved to Singapore, where she worked for four years. She also worked in the Netherlands and Azerbaijan. Then, during a vacation trip to Kozhikode in 2015, she was unexpectedly nominated as a candidate in Kerala's local body elections, thanks to her family's RSS connect. ""Politics was never on my mind, and my entry into it was purely accidental. The BJP approached me with a ticket, considering my family's political background. I was fielded from Karaparamba, a ward where the BJP traditionally finishes third in Kozhikode Corporation. However, I won and have been representing the ward for the past 10 years,"" she explained. Reflecting on her campaign for Wayanad, Ms. Haridas mentioned the challenges of travelling through the region. ""It takes hours to reach Kalpetta, especially crossing the Thamarassery Ghat Road, where traffic jams last for several hours. The traffic problems and the backwardness in the health sector here must be addressed immediately. Wayanad still lacks a fully equipped medical college. Currently, a district hospital has been upgraded as a medical college,"" she said. ""Another pressing issue is the upliftment of the tribal communities. The tribal people are still suffering. The funds allocated for them by the Central Government are not reaching their hands due to the lapses of the people's representatives. Besides, there are no plans for the educational facilities for the tribal students,"" she added. The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency consists of seven Assembly segments — Mananthavady (ST), Sulthan Bathery (ST) and Kalpetta in Wayanad district, Thiruvambady in Kozhikode district and Eranad, Nilambur, and Wandoor in Malappuram district. Of these Wandoor, Kalpetta abd Sulthan Bathery are represented by the Congress The Eranad seat is held by P K Basheer of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), an ally of the Congress-led UDF. Independent Nilambur MLA P V Anwar, who recently parted ways with the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, has already expressed support for Vadra. Thiruvambady and Mananthavady have CPI(M) MLAs. The constituency has a significant population of minorities and tribal communities.

Pradesh in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls Eminent CPI leader and former MLA Sathyan Mokeri is contesting on the CPIMled ruling LDF ticket The fight is only between Congress and BJP See this election was necessitated due to the irresponsibility of Congress In many parts of Wayanad you still see flex boards asking for votes for Rahul Gandhi However he chose to keep the Rae Bareli seat and handed Wayanad over to his sister This is an example of family dominance and the BJP will highlight this issue before the voters Ms Haridas said Navya who is also the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha BJPs womens wing believes PM Narendra Modis development agenda will work in favour of the party in Wayanad BJP always puts forward the agenda of development There has been no intervention from the peoples representatives in the issues demanded by the people here for the past several years She said Wayanad is not a constituency where the BJP has a strong organisational foothold but pointed out at its electoral gains However the partys vote share doubled compared to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls Moreover we saw that people voted for the BJP in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir and it showed that people want the BJP in power We expect that kind of change will happen here also she said In the 2024 elections the BJP saw its vote share in Wayanad rise to 575 per cent when its state president K Surendran took on Rahul Gandhi The NDA candidate secured 141045 votes a significant increase from the 78816 votes in 2019 when the seat was contested by BDJS an NDA ally Meanwhile Rahul Gandhis victory margin decreased to 364422 down from the 431770 votes polled in 2019 Ms Haridas an engineering graduate entered politics almost by accident After earning her BTech degree she worked as a software professional In 2009 she married marine engineer Shobin Shyam and moved to Singapore where she worked for four years She also worked in the Netherlands and Azerbaijan Then during a vacation trip to Kozhikode in 2015 she was unexpectedly nominated as a candidate in Keralas local body elections thanks to her familys RSS connect Politics was never on my mind and my entry into it was purely accidental The BJP approached me with a ticket considering my familys political background I was fielded from Karaparamba a ward where the BJP traditionally finishes third in Kozhikode Corporation However I won and have been representing the ward for the past 10 years she explained Reflecting on her campaign for Wayanad Ms Haridas mentioned the challenges of travelling through the region It takes hours to reach Kalpetta especially crossing the Thamarassery Ghat Road where traffic jams last for several hours The traffic problems and the backwardness in the health sector here must be addressed immediately Wayanad still lacks a fully equipped medical college Currently a district hospital has been upgraded as a medical college she said Another pressing issue is the upliftment of the tribal communities The tribal people are still suffering The funds allocated for them by the Central Government are not reaching their hands due to the lapses of the peoples representatives Besides there are no plans for the educational facilities for the tribal students she added The Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency consists of seven Assembly segments  Mananthavady ST Sulthan Bathery ST and Kalpetta in Wayanad district Thiruvambady in Kozhikode district and Eranad Nilambur and Wandoor in Malappuram district Of these Wandoor Kalpetta abd Sulthan Bathery are represented by the Congress The

Ranji Trophy 2024-25: Sanat Sangwan’s resistant 83 helps Delhi escape with draw against Tamil Nadu,"Published : Oct 21, 2024 19:57 IST , NEW DELHI - 2 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  Delhi’s batter Sanat Sangwan in acton against Tamil Nadu during the 4th day of Ranji Trophy cricket match against Tamil Nadu. | Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR/ The Hindu Sanat Sangwan’s defiant 83, and a bit of deliberate time-wasting by Navdeep Saini as the shadows lengthened, helped Delhi escape with a draw in its second-round Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday. The final day’s play stretched beyond 5 p.m. as Delhi, in its bid to escape an innings defeat, hung on in fading light with two wickets in hand to come away with a point. Tamil Nadu bagged three points, having secured a 408-run first-innings lead by restricting Delhi to 266 for nine (Dhruv Kaushik was unable to bat due to a hand injury). At the start of the second innings, Delhi, asked to follow on, was required to see out 85 overs to thwart the visiting team’s hopes of a victory. In the end, Delhi was 193 for eight in 83 overs, with the umpires deciding that the light was no longer good enough for another two overs. ALSO READ | Yash Dhull savouring ‘new innings’ with century for Delhi vs Tamil Nadu This was after Tamil Nadu had already been instructed two balls into the 81st over to resort to spin. Pacer Sonu Yadav had to switch to bowling loopy off-breaks to complete that over before skipper N. Jagadeesan went to spinners Washington Sundar and S. Ajith Ram with the second new ball.  Even one wicket may have been enough given Kaushik’s injury, but Saini and Himanshu Chauhan didn’t allow it to come to that. Saini’s gamesmanship was a tad comical — off the second ball of the 81st over, he was hit on his head by a bouncer from Yadav. He initially gestured with his right hand to suggest he was alright before the match situation dawned on him; what followed was hysterical play-acting as he walked away from the pitch and fell to the turf to demand the physio’s attention. Sangwan also played his part earlier in the innings by consuming 231 deliveries. In retrospect, Tamil Nadu may rue batting as long as it did for its mammoth total in the first innings.

IND vs NZ 2nd Test: Low & Slow Track Expected in Pune as India Look to Bounce Back | Report,"Curated By: Aakash Biswas News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 19:22 IST Pune, India Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune After the Bengaluru debacle, India look desperate to make a comeback in Pune before it gets too late in the three-match series against New Zealand. Moreover, the pressure to win 2-1 has now surmounted the hosts to stay ahead in the World Test Championship (WTC) final race. In order to do so, the tracks for the next two Tests – in Pune and Mumbai – are expected to remain low and slow, assisting majorly the Indian spinners. According to ESPNcricinfo, the Pune track is expected to have lower bounce compared to the first Test in Bengaluru; it is much flatter and slower. The same was expected at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as well, but the overcast conditions and repeated showers made the conditions favourable for the fast bowlers, which New Zealand used to bring India to their knees after they elected to bat first. Meanwhile, the team management called up spin all-rounder Washington Sundar, who was part of the Tamil Nadu playing XI for the Ranji Trophy Round 2 fixture against Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. Sundar’s inclusion indicates that India will once again deploy a spin-heavy attack against the Kiwis to jump back to winning ways. The report further stated that the Pune pitch would be ‘devoid of grass’, offering minimal seam movement. However, the dry surface is likely to support reverse swing. Thus, the toss shall be crucial once again. Third Test at Pune’s MCA Stadium This is going to be the third Test at Pune’s Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. The inaugural Test here was the opening game of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2016-17, which saw Australia crushing India by 333 runs. Left-arm spinner Steve O’Keefe ran through the Indian batting order, scalping 12 wickets in the match. The pitch was rated poor by ICC match referee Chris Broad, as spinners picked up 31 out of 40 wickets in the match. The next Test at this venue saw Virat Kohli smashing a double hundred against South Africa in 2019 as India registered a victory by an innings and 137 runs.",Curated By Aakash Biswas News18com Last Updated OCTOBER 21 2024 1922 IST Pune India Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium Pune After the Bengaluru debacle India look desperate to make a comeback in Pune before it gets too late in the threematch series against New Zealand Moreover the pressure to win 21 has now surmounted the hosts to stay ahead in the World Test Championship WTC final race In order to do so the tracks for the next two Tests  in Pune and Mumbai  are expected to remain low and slow assisting majorly the Indian spinners According to ESPNcricinfo the Pune track is expected to have lower bounce compared to the first Test in Bengaluru it is much flatter and slower The same was expected at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium as well but the overcast conditions and repeated showers made the conditions favourable for the fast bowlers which New Zealand used to bring India to their knees after they elected to bat first Meanwhile the team management called up spin allrounder Washington Sundar who was part of the Tamil Nadu playing XI for the Ranji Trophy Round 2 fixture against Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium Sundars inclusion indicates that India will once again deploy a spinheavy attack against the Kiwis to jump back to winning ways The report further stated that the Pune pitch would be devoid of grass offering minimal seam movement However the dry surface is likely to support reverse swing Thus the toss shall be crucial once again Third Test at Punes MCA Stadium This is going to be the third Test at Punes Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium The inaugural Test here was the opening game of the BorderGavaskar Trophy 201617 which saw Australia crushing India by 333 runs Leftarm spinner Steve OKeefe ran through the Indian batting order scalping 12 wickets in the match The pitch was rated poor by ICC match referee Chris Broad as spinners picked up 31 out of 40 wickets in the match The next Test at this venue saw Virat Kohli smashing a double hundred against South Africa in 2019 as India registered a victory by an innings and 137 runs,Toxic
Marital rape case highlights | Supreme Court to hear pleas on criminalisation of marital rape,"Updated - October 22, 2024 04:14 pm IST A general view of Supreme Court. | Photo Credit: The Hindu The Supreme Court will continue hearing on Wednesday (October 23, 2024) pleas related to the question of whether a man should continue to enjoy legal protection for forcing his wife, who is not a minor, to have sex with him. Explained | Marital rape: What are the legal issues in consideration before the Supreme Court? In the hearing on October 17, Senior advocate Karuna Nandy, appearing for AIDWA argued that a rapist remains a rapist, and marriage with his victim does not absolve him of the crime. Also Read | Unpacking the Centre’s affidavit on marital rape The discourse surrounding the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) involves several critical questions of law — does marriage endow husbands with the right to expect sexual relations, and does it entail implied consent for sex by the wife? Can this presumption of consent be rescinded in instances of sexual abuse within the marital bond?  The Marital Rape Exception (MRE), in Section 63, Exception 2 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (Section 375, Exception 2 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860) states that ‘Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.’ The provision is under challenge before the Supreme Court of India and the Centre has filed an affidavit in support of MRE which needs unpacking.  The court took seven years to hear petitions seeking to criminalise marital rape before coming up with a split verdict. Supreme Court questions penal law on marital rape, petitioners seek criminalization, government argues against impact on marriage.

"UCL 2024-25: Mentality alone not enough to survive against Real Madrid, says Dortmund coach Sahin","Published : Oct 22, 2024 09:23 IST , MADRID - 2 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  Borussia Dortmund coach Nuri Sahin, who played for both clubs, will visit Bernabeu for the first time as a coach following his appointment last summer.  | Photo Credit: REUTERS Borussia Dortmund will need more than just a strong mindset when it visits champions Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday, coach Nuri Sahin said as last year’s two finalists meet again in the competition’s new league phase. Real won its 15th European Cup in June at Wembley with Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Jr. scoring late to claim a 2-0 victory over a Dortmund team who had threatened an upset win after dominating the first hour. “Mentality only is not enough to survive against Real Madrid, especially in this stadium, against the champions of this competition,” Sahin told a press conference on Monday. “We need everything tomorrow. We need a lot of quality, a lot of self-confidence, mentality of course and also, as we say in Germany, game luck. READ | No Arda Guler joy for Juventus fans as social media account hacked “The game has to go our way, so only mentality will not be enough - but of course without mentality we have absolutely no chance here.” Dortmund maintained a winning start to the competition with a home 7-1 thrashing of Celtic earlier this month after it picked up a 3-0 win at Club Brugge in the opening fixture. It currently leads the standings on six points with an impressive goal difference of nine. “It’s only possible (to continue this way) as a collective against this team,” Sahin added. “The lads know what we have planned for tomorrow. We want to be brave and build on the last two games in the Champions League.” Sahin, who played for both clubs, will visit Bernabeu for the first time as a coach following his appointment last summer. The former Turkey midfielder was Edin Terzic’s assistant manager at the club prior to that. “(Being back at the Santiago Bernabeu) means a lot to me because it was always my dream to play one day for Real Madrid. My son was born in this beautiful city, and I have him with me (here),” Sahin said. “Now I have the privilege to be tomorrow on the sideline with my childhood club against one of my biggest dreams, so it means a lot to me. “Even if it was not that long that I played for Real Madrid, it will always remain special for me. Not only for footballing reasons but also family-wise, it’s a fantastic thing to be here.” Sahin was signed by Real from Dortmund in May 2011 before he was sent to Liverpool on loan a year later. He went back to Dortmund in early 2013, initially also on a loan deal, before the club made his return permanent in April 2014.

In June 2022, Durga Prasad of Ainavalli was allegedly strangled to death on a boat on the Godavari river at the Kotipalli Ghat in Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Konaseema district.  On October 20, 2024, the police reportedly arrested Pinipe Srikanth, son of former Social Welfare Minister Pinipe Viswaroop, in connection with the murder case, in Tamil Nadu. On Monday, Mr. Viswaroop alleged that Mr. Subhash was behind the arrest of his son. Reacting to the allegations, Mr. Subhash, at a press conference here, said the victim’s wife had sought justice. She had also stated that Mr. Viswaroop had promised her two acres of land for withdrawal of the murder case but had not kept the word, he said. Stating that he had taken the victim’s wife to meet the Director General of Police and the Inspector General of Police seeking a fresh investigation into the case, he said the police launched a probe, leading to the arrest of Mr. Srikanth. Mr. Subhash demanded that Mr. Viswaroop state reasons for the closure of the murder case during the YSR Congress Party regime. Meanwhile, Minister Nara Lokesh alleged on social media platform ‘X’ that Mr. Srikanth eliminated Durga Prasad as he was feeling insecure over the victim’s growing popularity. “Driven insecure by his growing popularity, YSRCP Minister Pinipe Viswarupa’s son, Srikanth, who aspired to a ticket, allegedly murdered Durga Prasad, a rising Dalit Youth leader.” “Recently, placing their trust in the NDA Government, Mr. Durga Prasad’s family summoned the courage to demand justice for him and filed a complaint. The police have arrested Pinipe Srikanth and YSRCP Social Media Convenor Vaddi Dharmesh in connection with the murder,” said Mr. Lokesh in the post. The YSRCP cultivated a culture of violence and impunity, he said.

Delhi lower-order avoid innings defeat against TN,"CHENNAI: Riding on Sanat Sangwan's patient 83 (231b. 12x4) Delhi forced a draw upon Tamil Nadu on the final day of the Ranji Trophy match played at the Arun Jaitley stadium on Monday. After Delhi folded for 266 in 100 overs with Dhruv unable to bat and Yash Dhull unbeaten on 105, the hosts were made to follow on. Delhi had to play out 85 overs to draw the game. For Tamil Nadu, it was a case of so near yet so far as the Delhi tail wagged for a while and later bad light played spoilsport as the game was called off when two overs were left to be bowled with Delhi having two wickets in hand. Delhi were 193/8 in 83 overs in their second essay. ""It was an exciting game which went down to the wire. Had we got to bowl the two overs anything could have happened. For me it was a good learning experience on how to go about the task in a tight game,"" said Tamil Nadu spinner Ajith Ram. Delhi batters were aware they had a mountain to climb and knew that the task was difficult but not impossible. Delhi captain Himmat Singh had told his players that they had to fight till the finish and be professionals. They started the second innings in earnest after Yash Dhull fell cheaply. Himmat, who failed to open his account in the first essay, played positively to ease the pressure. But he fell to the guile of Washington Sundar. Jonty Sidhu too fell in similar fashion to Ajith Ram. After the Tamil Nadu new ball bowlers bowled a couple of overs in the morning, Washington Sundar and Ajith Ram were brought into the attack and the duo bowled the chunk of the overs in tandem. Washington bowled tightly with probing lines, while Ajith flighted the ball a lot more. The duo at times were able to check the run flow and also gave breakthroughs in turns. ""Washington bowled really well. He has always been helpful for me and discusses on what lines to bowl to whom and when and so on,"" said Ajith Ram. Sanat Sangwan, playing his second first-class match, showed a lot of maturity and played with purpose. His effort was the main reason for Delhi to escape with a draw. ""The wicket was good to bat upon. Having said that, Sanat played really well. He applied himself and played to the merit of the ball and almost stayed till the end,"" insisted Ajith Ram. Towards the end of the day's play Sanat was done by change of pace and fell to Sonu Yadav. After Sanat's exit, Tamil Nadu captain N Jagadeesan tried his level best to press for a win. He brought in Gurjapneet Singh, M Mohammed and Sonu, who bowled in turns. After there was a visibility issue, he brought in Washington and Ajith Ram but in the end Navdeep Saini (15 n.o. 64b), Harsh (7; 28b) and Pranav (10, 41b) wagged their tail to deny the visitors a victory.

"P Diddy Lands in More Trouble: Sean Combs Faces 7 New Lawsuits, Accused of Raping Teenage Girl","Published By: Dishya Sharma Associated Press Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 14:35 IST Mumbai, India Diddy is facing multiple sexual crime charges. (Reuters) Seven new lawsuits have been filed against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, including one alleging the rape of a 13-year-old girl. They come as his lawyers tried again Monday to get him freed on bail, and complained that a “fresh wave of publicity” is endangering his right to a fair criminal trial. In the lawsuits filed Sunday in state and federal courts, four men and three women, all anonymous, allege they were sexually assaulted by Combs at parties over the last two decades. Combs, 54, has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson, and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Combs’ lawyers asked a judge Sunday to order potential witnesses and their lawyers to stop making statements that could prevent a fair trial. “As the Court is aware, Mr. Combs has been the target of an unending stream of allegations by prospective witnesses and their counsel in the press,” they wrote. “These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr. Combs’s character in the press.” The latest lawsuits are drawn from what lawyers say are more than 100 accusers who are planning legal action against Combs. Plaintiffs’ lawyer Tony Buzbee announced the planned litigation at an Oct. 1 news conference and posted a 1-800 number for accusers to call. As before, Combs’ representatives dismissed the latest lawsuits as “clear attempts to garner publicity.” They said Combs and his legal team “have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process.” Combs “has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman,” they added. One of the lawsuits filed Sunday alleges that a 13-year-old girl who was invited to a party by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000 was raped by a “male celebrity” and then by Combs as individuals identified only as “Celebrity A,” a male, and “Celebrity B,” a female, watched. Another lawsuit alleged that Combs sexually assaulted a 17-year-old male at a Manhattan hotel penthouse party in 2022. In the lawsuits, it was alleged that the plaintiffs believed they had been fed drinks laced with drugs before they were assaulted. Meanwhile, lawyers for Combs on Monday told the 2nd Circuit in a filing that he’ll renew his bail application before the lower court based on “significant changed circumstances.” They said the issues include “constitutional concerns stemming from his conditions of confinement and evidence contained in recently produced discovery.” In a filing last week, prosecutors told the appeals court that judges denied bail after evidence showed Combs “used methodical and sophisticated means to silence and intimidate witnesses throughout the racketeering conspiracy and during the Government’s investigation.”",Published By Dishya Sharma Associated Press Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 1435 IST Mumbai India Diddy is facing multiple sexual crime charges Reuters Seven new lawsuits have been filed against Sean Diddy Combs including one alleging the rape of a 13yearold girl They come as his lawyers tried again Monday to get him freed on bail and complained that a fresh wave of publicity is endangering his right to a fair criminal trial In the lawsuits filed Sunday in state and federal courts four men and three women all anonymous allege they were sexually assaulted by Combs at parties over the last two decades Combs 54 has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept 16 arrest Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years aided by associates and employees and silenced victims through blackmail and violence including kidnapping arson and physical beatings He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals Combs lawyers asked a judge Sunday to order potential witnesses and their lawyers to stop making statements that could prevent a fair trial As the Court is aware Mr Combs has been the target of an unending stream of allegations by prospective witnesses and their counsel in the press they wrote These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr Combss character in the press The latest lawsuits are drawn from what lawyers say are more than 100 accusers who are planning legal action against Combs Plaintiffs lawyer Tony Buzbee announced the planned litigation at an Oct 1 news conference and posted a 1800 number for accusers to call As before Combs representatives dismissed the latest lawsuits as clear attempts to garner publicity They said Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts their legal defenses and the integrity of the judicial process Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone  adult or minor man or woman they added One of the lawsuits filed Sunday alleges that a 13yearold girl who was invited to a party by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000 was raped by a male celebrity and then by Combs as individuals identified only as Celebrity A a male and Celebrity B a female watched Another lawsuit alleged that Combs sexually assaulted a 17yearold male at a Manhattan hotel penthouse party in 2022 In the lawsuits it was alleged that the plaintiffs believed they had been fed drinks laced with drugs before they were assaulted Meanwhile lawyers for Combs on Monday told the 2nd Circuit in a filing that hell renew his bail application before the lower court based on significant changed circumstances They said the issues include constitutional concerns stemming from his conditions of confinement and evidence contained in recently produced discovery In a filing last week prosecutors told the appeals court that judges denied bail after evidence showed Combs used methodical and sophisticated means to silence and intimidate witnesses throughout the racketeering conspiracy and during the Governments investigation,Toxic

Champions League 2024-25: Emery wants to ‘break barriers’ at transformed Aston Villa,"Published : Oct 21, 2024 22:57 IST , BIRMINGHAM - 3 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  Aston Villa manager Unai Emery attends a press conference at Bodymoor Heath Training Centre, Birmingham, England, Monday Oct. 21, 2024. | Photo Credit: AP Unai Emery is determined to ensure Aston Villa’s Champions League success is not a flash in the pan as the Spaniard aims to “break barriers” at a club he has transformed. Villa are off to their best start in the Premier League since 1998, with 17 points from their opening eight games and have won their first two fixtures in the Champions League, including a famous victory over Bayern Munich. Emery is a specialist in European competition, having won the Europa League four times and led Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals two years ago. Prior to this season, Villa’s last experience at the highest level of European football was back in 1983, while it has not won a trophy since 1996. But Emery wants to maintain the standards he has set since taking charge two years ago. “I don’t want to waste my time here, that is my message,” he said ahead of Bologna’s visit to Villa Park in the Champions League on Tuesday. ALSP READ | Juventus determined to excel in Europe and Italy, says coach Thiago Motta “My objective here is to keep the same level we have now, Champions League and add more to be contenders for titles. “We want to achieve the objectives and one of them is to play in the Champions League. It is not about playing there only because of some circumstances -- I want to us to stay there for a long time. “It is difficult. Maybe sometimes you can have some problems or struggle in our way, but you have to be resilient. We want to be strong in the idea in our mind and create a strong mentality to always break barriers.” Victory over the Italians would likely give Villa enough points to progress to at least the play-off round of the Champions League with five games to spare. Emery’s men are also above the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United in the Premier League table, all of whom they beat to a top-four finish last season. “We are fourth in the Premier League, we are with two wins in the Champions League,” added Emery. “Tomorrow hopefully we will play showing we believe we can compete. I don’t know how far we are going to get but in this moment we are here, in a good position in the Premier League and Champions League.” Defender Matty Cash is set for his Champions League bow after missing the wins over Young Boys and Bayern due to injury. “In the last four years since I joined, the club has just gone through the roof, the quality in every single department has gone up and the club has not got a ceiling,” said Cash. “I think it can go all the way to the top. You can see now playing Champions League football has been a building block to get here and the manager has been a big part of that to get us here.” COMMENTS Aston Villa / Champions League / Premier League / Villarreal / Bayern Munich / Bologna / Tottenham BACK TO TOP",Published  Oct 21 2024 2257 IST  BIRMINGHAM  3 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  Aston Villa manager Unai Emery attends a press conference at Bodymoor Heath Training Centre Birmingham England Monday Oct 21 2024  Photo Credit AP Unai Emery is determined to ensure Aston Villas Champions League success is not a flash in the pan as the Spaniard aims to break barriers at a club he has transformed Villa are off to their best start in the Premier League since 1998 with 17 points from their opening eight games and have won their first two fixtures in the Champions League including a famous victory over Bayern Munich Emery is a specialist in European competition having won the Europa League four times and led Villarreal to the Champions League semifinals two years ago Prior to this season Villas last experience at the highest level of European football was back in 1983 while it has not won a trophy since 1996 But Emery wants to maintain the standards he has set since taking charge two years ago I dont want to waste my time here that is my message he said ahead of Bolognas visit to Villa Park in the Champions League on Tuesday ALSP READ  Juventus determined to excel in Europe and Italy says coach Thiago Motta My objective here is to keep the same level we have now Champions League and add more to be contenders for titles We want to achieve the objectives and one of them is to play in the Champions League It is not about playing there only because of some circumstances  I want to us to stay there for a long time It is difficult Maybe sometimes you can have some problems or struggle in our way but you have to be resilient We want to be strong in the idea in our mind and create a strong mentality to always break barriers Victory over the Italians would likely give Villa enough points to progress to at least the playoff round of the Champions League with five games to spare Emerys men are also above the likes of Chelsea Tottenham and Manchester United in the Premier League table all of whom they beat to a topfour finish last season We are fourth in the Premier League we are with two wins in the Champions League added Emery Tomorrow hopefully we will play showing we believe we can compete I dont know how far we are going to get but in this moment we are here in a good position in the Premier League and Champions League Defender Matty Cash is set for his Champions League bow after missing the wins over Young Boys and Bayern due to injury In the last four years since I joined the club has just gone through the roof the quality in every single department has gone up and the club has not got a ceiling said Cash I think it can go all the way to the top You can see now playing Champions League football has been a building block to get here and the manager has been a big part of that to get us here COMMENTS Aston Villa  Champions League  Premier League  Villarreal  Bayern Munich  Bologna  Tottenham BACK TO TOP,Non-Toxic

6 Working On J&K’s Z-Morh Tunnel Killed In Ganderbal Terror Attack: Why The Infrastructure Project Matters,"Reported By: Nivedita Singh News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 13:34 IST New Delhi, India Once operational, the Z-Morh tunnel will offer round-the-year connectivity to Sonamarg from Srinagar and will bypass the avalanche-prone area near Gagangeer. (PTI File) At a time when the work of the Z-Morh tunnel was almost complete, terrorists gunned down six migrant workers, employed by the infrastructure company carrying out the work, at their camp on Sunday. The tunnel is important for the country as it offers an all-weather road between Srinagar and Sonamarg and seamless connectivity to Kargil, while reducing the travel time to Leh from the capital of the union territory. Once operational, it will offer round-the-year connectivity to Sonamarg from Srinagar and will bypass the avalanche-prone area near Gagangeer. ALSO READ | NIA Team Reaches Ganderbal Terror Site; J&K L-G Says ‘Brutal Attack Will Be Avenged’ The existing road remains closed during the winters due to heavy snowfall and avalanches in the area. The new tunnel will also promote social and economic development in the region. At least 19 tunnels are being constructed in Jammu and Kashmir at a cost of Rs 25,000 crore to ensure all-weather connectivity across the region. The work on the Z-Morh tunnel is part of this big project. The 6.5-km tunnel and approach road is being built at a cost of about Rs 2,700 crore. According to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH), the area of Z-Morh tunnel is strategically important as its construction will ensure seamless connectivity between Srinagar and Kargil and there will also be considerable reduction in travel time between Srinagar and Leh. Apart from tourists, the road will allow faster movement of forces to and from Ladakh. #BreakingNews: L-G Manoj meets those injured in Ganderbal attack in which migrant workers were targeted; L-G said, ‘punishment that will be remembered by the terrorists will be given…’ @TejinderSsodhi shares more with @GrihaAtul | #JammuKashmir #GanderbalTerroristAttack pic.twitter.com/zJn5MbzqEW— News18 (@CNNnews18) October 21, 2024 Situated under the mountain glacier Thajiwas Glacier between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district of Kashmir, the Z-Morh tunnel is two-laned. The main tunnel is 10.8 meters with a modified horseshoe shape escape tunnel of total length of 7.5 meters. It has a D-shaped ventilation tunnel of total length of 8.3 meters and two major culverts of total length of 110 meters and 270 meters, one small culvert of total length of 30 meters is also proposed. The name of the road is derived from its shape and will connect Sonamarg health resort with Kangan town in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district – about 20 km from Srinagar. An Intelligent Traffic Management System has already been installed in the tunnel that will ease the traffic management. Traffic will be facilitated through the dedicated escape tunnel. In October 2012 the foundation stone of the project was laid by Omar Abdullah, then Chief Minister of the erstwhile state J&K, along with his father and then Union Cabinet Minister Farooq Abdullah. Rahul Gandhi, who was the Congress general secretary at that time, was also a part of the ceremony. The work, awarded to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), also started. However, it was abandoned after IL&FS Group faced a financial crisis. The MoRTH again issued tenders. Finally, the work was awarded to APCO Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd in December 2019. The initial deadline was December 2023. That was missed. The project cost, in December 2019, was Rs 2,378.76 crore and it had to be completed in 3.5 years.

Vijayawada flood victims to stage dharna on October 23 demanding compensation,"Published - October 21, 2024 09:05 pm IST - VIJAYAWADA CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao | Photo Credit: File Photo CPI(M) has called for a protest in front of the MRO office at Ajithsingh Nagar on October 23 to highlight the plight of flood victims. The party State secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao and others visited flood-affected areas such as Ajitsingh Nagar in the city on Monday. Mr. Babu Rao said that hundreds of families were still waiting for assistance from the State government even though 50 days have passed since the floods inundated a few localities in the city. The flood victims, in anguish, were complaining that they had not yet received any help despite running around various government offices. Many have not received even a single rupee in assistance. Some received only ₹10,000 in compensation instead of the promised ₹25,000, and the reason cited to them was that they lived on the first floor even though they were on the ground floor. Some families received ₹3,000 for vehicle damages, but no assistance was provided for the damages to their houses. Street vendors and small business owners have not received any compensation, with the government imposing conditions such as the need for a trade license to receive aid, he said. Mr. Babu Rao said that some auto-rickshaws were unused for 50 days because their owners could not afford repairs. The auto-rickshaw owners were helpless and surrendered their vehicles to financiers. Despite taking loans to purchase cars and running them for hire, no relief package has been announced for those whose cars were damaged in the flood. Though their names were on the list, no funds have been deposited in the victims’ bank accounts. The victims have been running around the secretariats, the offices of the MRO, the Collector, and even MLAs for several days but have not received any response, he said, adding that the victims would stage a protest near the MRO office.

Former Hollywood Producer Harvey Weinstein Diagnosed With Bone Marrow Cancer: US Media,"Curated By: Vani Mehrotra News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 09:42 IST New Delhi, India Harvey Weinstein (AP photo) Disgraced Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been diagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer, US media reported Monday. Weinstein, 72, has chronic myeloid leukemia and is undergoing treatment in a New York prison, NBC News and ABC News reported quoting sources. His diagnosis comes after a string of health issues for the once-powerful entertainment mogul, who appeared pale and visibly frail during a brief court appearance in September. Just a month before, Weinstein was indicted on a new sex crime charge. He underwent emergency heart surgery last month, after which his representative said he was “out of danger at the moment.” Weinstein is serving a 16-year prison sentence after being convicted on rape charges in California. He was also convicted in New York in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of an actress and of forcibly performing oral sex on a production assistant. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison in that case. Allegations against Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement in 2017, a watershed moment for women fighting sexual misconduct. More than 80 women accused him of harassment, sexual assault or rape, including prominent actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd.

Bihar Assembly bypolls: Parties hand out tickets to kin,"Updated - October 21, 2024 09:31 pm IST - Patna Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor with party candidate for the Tararil Assembly bye-election, SK Singh (right) during a press conference in Patna, on October 16, 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI In the Bihar byelection for four seats, scheduled to be held on November 13, major political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal-United (JD-U), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and the Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S), have opted to field kin of party leaders as their candidates. Meanwhile, a row erupted over the announcement by political strategist and founder of the Jan Suraaj Party Prashant Kishor that former Vice Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General S.K. Singh (Retd.) as his party’s candidate for the Tarari Assembly bypoll. Lt. Gen. Singh is not registered as a voter in the State and is thus ineligible to contest. Mr. Kishor has said Lt. Gen. Singh had submitted Form 8A to the Election Commission of India to include his name in the voters’ list. Mr. Kishor had earlier announced the candidature of Lt. Gen. Singh from Tarari, academician Khilafat Hussain from Belaganj, and paediatrician Jitendra Paswan from Imamganj. Speaking to media persons in Bhabhua (Kaimur), Mr. Kishor said that he would announce the name of his party’s candidate for the fourth Assembly seat, Ramgarh, on October 22, from among the five prospective names he had announced on Monday. The BJP has named Vishal Prashant as its candidate for the Tarari (Bhojpur) seat. Mr. Prashant is the son of a former bahubali (strongman) MLA of the Piro Assembly constituency, Sunil Kumar Pandey alias Narendra Kumar Pandey. Mr. Pandey, along with his son, joined the BJP in August. “It is not Mr. Pandey but his son who has been fielded by the party,” State BJP leaders told The Hindu. The JD(U) has fielded Manorama Devi as the party’s candidate for the Belaganj Assembly bypoll. Ms. Devi is the wife of the notorious Bindi Yadav, and mother of Rocky Yadav, the main accused in the sensational Gaya road rage incident, in which 18-year-old Aaditya Sachdeva was killed in May 2016. The RJD has picked Vishwanath Kumar Singh, son of the party’s MP from Jehanabad Surendra Yadav, as the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) candidate against Ms. Devi in Belaganj. The party has nominated Ajit Singh, son of the State party chief Jagdanand Singh, for the Ramgarh Assembly bypoll. Mr. Jagdanand Singh hails from Ramgarh and has won Assembly elections from there before. Another son of Mr. Jagdanand Singh, Sudhakar Singh, won in the 2020 Assembly election, but he won the Buxar parliamentary seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha election against the BJP’s candidate Mithilesh Tiwari. Like other allies of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi too chose to field a member of his family, his daughter-in-law Deepa Manjhi, wife of Santosh Kumar Suman alias Manjhi, the Minister of Information Technology, Minor Irrigation, and Disaster Management in Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Cabinet, from the Imamganj (reserved) Assembly seat. The RJD has fielded Raushan Kumar Manjhi to contest against Ms. Deepa Manjhi. Mr. Prashant Kishor has taken flak for his party’s lack of “political-electoral preparedness and foresight” over Lt. Gen. Singh’s candidature. “He (Lt. Gen. Singh) has been a voter of Bihar but recently, he had registered his name as a voter of Noida, where he has been living after his retirement from military service, but he has submitted Form 8A to include his name in the Bihar voters’ list again,” Mr. Kishor said. The Jan Suraaj Party, though, has been gearing up to field someone else, if the party’s technical team, which is examining the issue, is unable to resolve obstacles to Lt. Gen. Singh’s candidature, party leaders said. Lt. Gen. Singh is a native of Karath village in the Tarari Assembly segment. Since the Model Code of Conduct has already been enforced for the four Assembly constituencies where byelections are scheduled, a senior source in the State Election Commissions told The Hindu, on condition of anonymity, that it was “not possible to change the voter registration at this point of time...In State Assembly and council elections, a candidate has to be a registered voter in the State, but in the parliamentary election, such a rule is not mandatory”.

Jaishankar slams Canada for its 'double standards',"Published - October 22, 2024 11:47 am IST - New Delhi External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar speaks at NDTV World Summit 2024, in New Delhi on Monday (October 21, 2024). | Photo Credit: ANI External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Monday (October 21, 2024) hit out at Canada for its “double standards” as the ties between New Delhi and Ottawa came under severe strain over the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil last year. “Double standards is a very mild word for it,” Mr. Jaishankar said while explaining how Canada treats other diplomats and the “licence” their diplomats try to use while in India. Last week, New Delhi expelled Canadian Charge d’Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats following Ottawa’s fresh allegations of the Indian Government’s involvement in Nijjar’s killing in British Columbia. India also recalled its high commissioner and five more diplomats, who are on their way back to India. The Canadian government had said the Indian diplomats were expelled from the country. “I think there are some very specific issues. Canada asked us to subject our high commissioner to a police inquiry and we chose to withdraw the high commissioner and diplomats,” Mr. Jaishankar said at the NDTV World Summit. “They seem to have a problem if Indian diplomats are even trying to make efforts to find out what is happening in Canada on matters which directly pertain to their welfare and security. “But look what happens in India. Canadian diplomats have no problem going around collecting information on our military, police, profiling people, targeting people to be stopped in Canada,” he said. “So apparently, the licence that they give themselves is totally different from the kind of restrictions that they impose on diplomats in Canada. When we tell them you have people openly threatening leaders of India, diplomats of India, their answer is freedom of speech,” Mr. Jaishankar added. The bilateral ties nosedived after Canada linked Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Verma and other diplomats to Nijjar’s killing. New Delhi has strongly rejected all the allegations made by Ottawa in connection to the case relating to the killing of Nijjar, who was a designated terrorist in India. “If you threaten the Indian high commissioner, he is supposed to accept it as freedom of speech, but if an Indian journalist says the Canadian high commissioner walked out of the South Block looking very grumpy, it is apparently foreign interference,” Mr. Jaishankar said. Asked about certain pro-Khalistani elements openly issuing threats to India’s airlines, diplomats and high commission, he said, “These threats are cleverly worded. They (the Canadian government) call this freedom of speech. But my question to them is – if you receive these threats, would you take them lightly?” the minister asked. “If it was your airline being threatened, your Parliament, your diplomats.... This is exactly the kind of problem with which we started this conversation,” he said. The External Affairs Minister said India is having a problem with a segment of Canadian politics. “We are having a problem with a segment of politics in Canada,” he said. “I think we would like to maintain people-to-people relations. I think we need to narrow this down and define this problem for what it is,” Mr. Jaishankar added.

Ranji Trophy | Sangwan helps Delhi escape with draw against Tamil Nadu,"Updated - October 21, 2024 11:08 pm IST - New Delhi Marathon knock: Sangwan scored a 231-ball 83. | Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR Sanat Sangwan’s defiant 83, and a bit of deliberate time-wasting by Navdeep Saini as the shadows lengthened, helped Delhi escape with a draw in its second-round Ranji Trophy match against Tamil Nadu at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday. The final day’s play stretched beyond 5 p.m. as Delhi, in its bid to escape an innings defeat, hung on in fading light with two wickets in hand to come away with a point. TN bagged three points, having secured a 408-run first-innings lead by restricting Delhi to 266 for nine (Dhruv Kaushik was unable to bat due to a hand injury). At the start of the second innings, Delhi, asked to follow on, was required to see out 85 overs to thwart the visiting team’s hopes of a victory. In the end, Delhi was 193 for eight in 83 overs, with the umpires deciding that the light was no longer good enough for another two overs. This was after the visitor had already been instructed two balls into the 81st over to resort to spin. Pacer Sonu Yadav had to switch to bowling loopy off-breaks to complete that over before skipper N. Jagadeesan went to spinners Washington Sundar and S. Ajith Ram with the second new ball.  Even one wicket may have been enough given Kaushik’s injury, but Saini and Himanshu Chauhan didn’t allow it to come to that. Saini was hit on his head by a bouncer from Sonu. | Photo Credit: SHIV KUMAR PUSHPAKAR Saini’s gamesmanship was a tad comical — off the second ball of the 81st over, he was hit on his head by a bouncer from Sonu. He initially gestured with his right hand to suggest he was alright before the match situation dawned on him; what followed was hysterical play-acting as he walked away from the pitch and fell to the turf to demand the physio’s attention. Sangwan also played his part earlier in the innings by consuming 231 deliveries. In retrospect, Tamil Nadu may rue batting as long as it did for its mammoth total in the first innings. The scores: Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: 674 for six decl.

"Jammu & Kashmir MLAs Administered Oath, CM Omar Abdullah Takes Pledge In Kashmiri","PTI Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 18:55 IST Srinagar, India The National Conference (NC) emerged as the single largest party in the assembly polls held in September and October. (Image: X/@JKNC) The newly elected members of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly were administered oath on Monday by pro-tem speaker Mubarak Gul, with Chief Minister Omar Abdullah taking the pledge in the Kashmiri language. The 54-year-old Leader of the House was the first MLA to be administered the oath. Omar Abdullah, son of Farooq Abdullah and his British wife Mollie Abdullah, had often faced criticism for not being able to speak his native language. Chief Minister @OmarAbdullah takes oath as member of Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in Kashmiri languageThe newly elected members of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly were administered oath on Monday by pro-tem speaker Mubarak Gul. pic.twitter.com/rzl02YNrUX — JKNC (@JKNC_) October 21, 2024 While the third generation politician from the Abdullah family is fluent in English , his fluency in vernaculars like Hindi, Urdu and Kashmiri was poor at the start of his political career in the late 1990s. However, during his first tenure as chief minister from 2009 to 2014, Omar Abdullah took lessons to improve his speaking skills in these three languages. And on Monday, he took the oath as MLA in Kashmiri. Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Kumar Choudhary took oath in English. The oath-taking ceremony of the MLAs marks an end to the six-year-long legislative hiatus. There are 51 first-time members including BJP MLA from Kishtwar Shagun Parihar, who is the youngest member at 29. The NC veteran and MLA from Chrar-e-Sharief, Abdul Rahim Rather, is the oldest at 80. Rather and party colleague Ali Mohammad Sagar (MLA Khanyar) have been elected to the assembly for a record seven terms. While Sagar has been a member of the Legislative Assembly since 1983, Rather started his long stint as a legislator in 1977. However, the former finance minister lost the 2014 assembly elections. The National Conference (NC) emerged as the single largest party in the assembly polls held in September and October. The oldest political party of Jammu and Kashmir has formed the government with external support from the Congress, which has six MLAs.  Five independent MLAs, one MLA from the AAP, and the CPI(M) have also extended their support. The BJP with 29 seats is the second-largest party — its best-ever performance in J-K.

The video uploaded on his YouTube channel has fetched 14 lakh views in two days. With the video doing the rounds on social media, J. Rajamoorthy, Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, on Monday (October 21, 2024) said show cause notices were being issued to the YouTuber as well as to the hospital in Sholinganallur where the baby was delivered. A report on the doctor who delivered the baby would also be sent to the Tamil Nadu Medical Council. A screengrab of the video in which YouTuber Irfan is seen cutting the umbilical cord of his infant daughter “We will issue the show cause notices and seek explanation from Irfan, the doctor, and the private hospital. An operation theatre should be sterile but he has taken a camera and shot a video inside. Only a trained healthcare personnel can cut the umbilical cord soon after delivery,” Dr. Rajamoorthy said. He added that action could be taken against the hospital under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishments Act. Irfan was caught in a controversy earlier after he disclosed the sex of his baby who was yet to be born, following a prenatal test done abroad.

"India, China agree on resolution of military standoff; Centre warns of action against perpetrators of bomb threat to flights and more in The Hindu’s top news of October 21, 2024.","Published - October 21, 2024 07:27 pm IST In this September 2020 file image, an Army convoy carrying military material on its way to Ladakh amid border tension with China. | Photo Credit: PTI In a dramatic development, India and China have reached an agreement on “patrolling arrangements ” and a resolution of the military standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) , the government announced on Monday (October 21, 2024). The patrolling arrangement agreement extends beyond the areas along the LAC where there has already been a disengagement of military personnel over the past few years, and include the so far unresolved areas of Demchok and Depsang, sources told The Hindu, indicating that the India-China standoff since April 2020 is now expected to be resolved. Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu on Monday said the government plans to take legislative actions to deal with instances of bomb threats to airlines, including placing perpetrators of such threats in the no-fly list. In the last one week, nearly 100 flights of Indian airlines received bomb threats. At a briefing in the national capital, Mr. Naidu said amendments are being planned to aviation security rules as well as the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against Safety of Civil Aviation Act, 1982. Protesting junior doctors in West Bengal arrived at the State secretariat on Monday to meet Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in an effort to resolve the ongoing impasse following the rape-murder of an on-duty woman medic at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The doctors, however, asserted that they would continue their hunger strike demanding justice for the murdered doctor, removal of Health Secretary NS Nigam and enhanced security for healthcare workers, among other issues. The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea filed by former Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal challenging an order of the Gujarat High Court refusing to quash summons in a defamation case over his alleged remarks over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s educational qualification. A bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy and S.V.N. Bhatti noted that a separate bench of the apex court had junked the plea filed by AAP leader Sanjay Singh on April 8 in the same case. The low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal on Monday intensified and is likely to turn into a cyclonic storm by October 23 which will cross between Puri in Odisha and Sagar island in West Bengal, the IMD said. The India Meteorological Department in its latest message said: “…continuing its move the system is very likely to cross north Odisha and West Bengal coasts between Puri and Sagar Island during the night of October 24 and early morning October 25 as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100-110 kmph with gusting 120 kmph.” Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini kept key departments, including Home and Finance, while Anil Vij got Energy and Transport as portfolios were allocated to the Council of Ministers on Sunday (October 20, 2024), three days after the swearing-in of a new government in the State. Mr. Saini will handle 12 portfolios. Besides Home and Finance, he is also in charge of Planning, Excise and Taxation, Town and Country planning and urban estates, Information, Public Relations, language and culture, criminal investigation, law and legislative, and Housing for all departments. Former Chief Minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Monday lashed out at Pakistan for perpetrating terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, saying Islamabad will have to stop terror incidents here if it wants to have friendly relations with India. Mr. Abdullah said there can be no talks between New Delhi and Islamabad till the neighbouring country stops killings in Jammu and Kashmir. Complying with the Delhi High Court order, the the Wikimedia Foundation has “suspended access” to a dedicated Wikipedia page on the ongoing defamation lawsuit filed by Asian News International (ANI) against Wikimedia. Earlier in August, ANI sued Wikipedia’s parent company Wikimedia Foundation for defamation, due to a description of the news agency as a propagator of government propaganda on the website. The Supreme Court on Monday fixed in the second week of January 2025 a challenge to the government’s decision to block the screening of a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) documentary series titled ‘India: The Modi Question’. A Bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna had issued formal notice to the Union of India through the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Twitter Communications India Private Limited and Google India Private Limited over a year ago, on February 3 last year. The court had listed the case in April then. The Supreme Court on Monday stressed on having “uniform standards” to the extent possible to ensure safety and security of students studying at coaching centres. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing a matter related to the deaths of three civil service aspirants at a coaching centre in the national capital in July due to the flooding in the building’s basement. The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a PIL seeking to replace the term ‘Hindutva’ with ‘Bharatiya Samidhaanitva’ (Indian constitutionalism). “This is a complete abuse of the process,” said the bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra while junking the PIL on the issue. The Supreme Court on Monday extended by two weeks the time granted to the Centre-appointed seven-member expert panel to file its report on exam reforms after reviewing the National Testing Agency’s functioning in holding the NEET-UG. The top court on August 2 had passed its formal order and expanded the remit of the seven-member expert panel, headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K. Radhakrishnan, to review the functioning of the National Testing Agency (NTA) and recommend exam reforms to make the controversy-ridden NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Undergraduate), transparent and free from malpractices. The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the operations of the communications issued by child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) urging States to shift students of unrecognised madrassas to government schools. A Bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra took note of the submissions of senior advocate, appearing for Muslim organisation Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, that the communications of the NCPCR and consequential actions of some of States needed to be stayed. Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has taken “necessary steps” to introduce India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the archipelago nation, slated to benefit the Maldivian economy substantially. Developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI is an instant real-time payment system for facilitating inter-bank transactions through mobile phones. Global finance chiefs will gather in Washington this week amid intense uncertainty over wars in the Middle East and Europe, a flagging Chinese economy and worries that a coin-toss U.S. presidential election could ignite new trade battles and erode multilateral cooperation. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings are scheduled to draw more than 10,000 people from finance ministries, central banks and civil society groups to discuss efforts to boost patchy global growth, deal with debt distress and finance the green energy transition. The world in 2022 reached its most ambitious deal ever to halt the destruction of nature by decade’s end. Two years later, countries are already behind on meeting their goals. As nearly 200 nations meet on Monday for a two-week U.N. biodiversity summit, COP16, in Cali, Colombia, they will be under pressure to prove their support for the goals laid out in theKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreement. A top concern for countries and companies is how to pay for conservation, with the COP16 talks aiming to develop new initiatives that could generate revenues for nature.

"Laws that regulate minority institutions do not breach secularism, says Supreme Court","Updated - October 22, 2024 01:22 am IST - New Delhi The Chief Justice pointed out that Article 30 enabled minorities to establish and administer their institutions which were not entirely confined to teaching of their religion. | Photo Credit: AP The Supreme Court on Monday (October 21, 2024) made a point that laws which regulate institutions run by religious or linguistic minorities, for that very reason alone, cannot be accused of breaching secularism. The oral observation by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a three-judge Bench, was hearing a challenge to a decision of the Allahabad High Court to strike down the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004. The 2004 Act regulated madrasas in the State. The High Court concluded that the law violated the principles of secularism. It had ordered the transfer of their students, especially those in recognised madrasas, to regular schools. Petitioners claimed in the top court that the verdict had affected the lives of nearly 17 lakh students spread across 16,000 madrasas in Uttar Pradesh. “A law per se regulating an institution belonging to a particular community does not ipso facto [by the fact itself] offend the principle of secularism,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed. The CJI referred to another Act in the same context, The Hindu Religious Endowments and Charitable Institutions Act, which provided for the “proper administration of religious institutions… and is there in all States from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu”. The Chief Justice said a State had a right to legislate to improve the excellence of a government-aided minority-run institution. “It is within a State’s vital interest. These are young children who come to madrasas. They need a broad-based education… They should learn the essentials of subjects required to lead a proper life, so they become worthy citizens,” the CJI observed. Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the 2004 Act was a regulatory statute of the State of Uttar Pradesh. “The High Court conflated regulations with religious instructions and concluded the law violated secularism,” Ms. Guruswamy submitted. The Chief Justice pointed out that Article 30 enabled minorities to establish and administer their institutions which were not entirely confined to teaching of their religion. “A Zoroastrian or Buddhist institution can teach medicine or engineering. There is no compulsion that a Buddhist institution should teach only Buddhism,” the CJI remarked. Petitioners argued that the High Court had found that madrasas violated Article 28 of the Constitution, which prohibited “religious instruction” in educational institutions fully funded by the State. They argued that academics in madrasas was a “mixture of science, mathematics, etc with certain portions of religious education and not religious instruction”. The Bench however questioned whether a certificate from a madrasa would be valid for a student to go outside its system for a postgraduation course. Ms. Guruswamy said the solicitations to give madrasas university status began in 2002, but there has been no headway. The court would resume the hearing on October 22.

Uproar in Bihar After Health Minister Wears 'Shoe Cover' on Head at Begusarai Hospital,"Curated By: Diksha Modi Translation Desk Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 13:40 IST Begusarai, India Health workers had placed a 'shoe cover' on the minister's head instead of a proper surgical cap. Bihar’s Health Minister Mangal Pandey has found himself at the centre of a social media firestorm following an incident at the Sadar Hospital in Begusarai. During an inspection visit at the facility, health workers had placed a ‘shoe cover’ on the minister’s head instead of a proper surgical cap, raising serious questions about the hospital’s protocols and the training of its staff. The incident occurred on Saturday as Pandey was preparing to tour the ICU ward. Photographs of the moment quickly circulated online, showing the minister adorned with a ‘shoe cover’ meant for covering footwear at the hospital while other officials, including Sports Minister Surendra Mehta and District Magistrate Tushar Singla, were not seen wearing any safety kit at all. This glaring oversight ignited public outrage, with many mocking the situation and questioning the competency of health personnel in the state. Critics, particularly from the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), seized upon the moment to highlight what they claim is indicative of systemic failures in Bihar’s healthcare system. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari condemned the incident as an embarrassment for the state’s administration. The incident reflected the dire state of hospitals and if this is how the health minister was treated, one can only imagine the conditions faced by the general public, he stated. In response to the backlash, Janata Dal (United) leaders defended both the minister and the health workers, labelling the incident a “human error.” JDU spokesperson Arvind Nishad criticised the RJD for politicising the situation, emphasising that Bihar’s healthcare had improved under the current government. While the RJD was in power, hospitals were overrun by stray animals, he said, adding that under Nitish Kumar’s rule, patients and ministers alike were visiting the hospitals. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also rallied behind Pandey. BJP spokesperson Neeraj Kumar explained that the materials used for shoe covers and surgical caps were similar, arguing that the health minister was focused on important work, including a new initiative for platelet treatments in Begusarai. Kumar pointed out that such initiatives will enhance dengue treatment, thereby benefitting the local population.",Curated By Diksha Modi Translation Desk Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 1340 IST Begusarai India Health workers had placed a shoe cover on the ministers head instead of a proper surgical cap Bihars Health Minister Mangal Pandey has found himself at the centre of a social media firestorm following an incident at the Sadar Hospital in Begusarai During an inspection visit at the facility health workers had placed a shoe cover on the ministers head instead of a proper surgical cap raising serious questions about the hospitals protocols and the training of its staff The incident occurred on Saturday as Pandey was preparing to tour the ICU ward Photographs of the moment quickly circulated online showing the minister adorned with a shoe cover meant for covering footwear at the hospital while other officials including Sports Minister Surendra Mehta and District Magistrate Tushar Singla were not seen wearing any safety kit at all This glaring oversight ignited public outrage with many mocking the situation and questioning the competency of health personnel in the state Critics particularly from the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal RJD seized upon the moment to highlight what they claim is indicative of systemic failures in Bihars healthcare system RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari condemned the incident as an embarrassment for the states administration The incident reflected the dire state of hospitals and if this is how the health minister was treated one can only imagine the conditions faced by the general public he stated In response to the backlash Janata Dal United leaders defended both the minister and the health workers labelling the incident a human error JDU spokesperson Arvind Nishad criticised the RJD for politicising the situation emphasising that Bihars healthcare had improved under the current government While the RJD was in power hospitals were overrun by stray animals he said adding that under Nitish Kumars rule patients and ministers alike were visiting the hospitals The Bharatiya Janata Party BJP also rallied behind Pandey BJP spokesperson Neeraj Kumar explained that the materials used for shoe covers and surgical caps were similar arguing that the health minister was focused on important work including a new initiative for platelet treatments in Begusarai Kumar pointed out that such initiatives will enhance dengue treatment thereby benefitting the local population,Toxic
"IND vs NZ second Test: No point sugarcoating, there's fight for a spot between Rahul and Sarfaraz, says Ryan ten Doeschate","Published - October 22, 2024 02:59 pm IST - Pune Sarfaraz Khan and KL Rahul are locked in a selection battle for the second Test against New Zealand in Pune which starts on October 24, 2024. | Photo Credit: The Hindu India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) that middle-order batters KL Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan are locked in a selection battle for the second Test against New Zealand in Pune even though head coach Gautam Gambhir is keen to give the former, a long rope. With India looking to bounce back from the eight-wicket thrashing at Bengaluru in the opening Test, focus will be on the team combination with Washington Sundar being added to the squad. Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant are both aiming to shake off injury concerns for the match starting on Thursday (October 24, 2024). ""Yeah, there's no point in sugarcoating it, there's a fight for a spot,"" ten Doeschate told the media when asked if Rahul and Sarfaraz were battling for a place in the team, in Pune at the MCA Stadium ahead of India's training session. Mohammed Siraj’s ‘Home Truth’: Pressure on pacer after only 19 wickets from 13 Tests in India IND vs NZ first Test: Why India lost to New Zealand in Bengaluru? IND vs NZ first Test: Those three hours are not going to dictate what this team is, says Rohit Sharma IND vs NZ first Test: We won four against England after losing first Test, says skipper Rohit ""Sarfaraz was obviously brilliant in the last Test. I went to KL after the last Test (and) said how many balls do you play at (and) miss at? He didn't play at (and) miss at one ball and that's what tends to happen when you're not getting runs. ""There's certainly no concerns about KL, he's batting nicely, he's in a good mental space. But we are certainly going to have to fit seven pieces into six spots for this Test and look at the pitch now and decide what's going to be best for the team,"" he said. Sarfaraz scored a second-innings 150 in the Bengaluru game, while Rahul remained off-colour in both essays. While admitting that it is difficult to keep Rahul out of the equation in the Test format, ten Doeschate said head coach Gautam Gambhir is ""keen to"" give him a long rope. ""It's not like we're worried about his form. If you go on just the past three months since Gauti has been in here, he's keen to give him (Rahul) as much rope as we can. We have a lot of faith in him,"" he said. ""But at the same time, it's a very competitive environment, with Sarfaraz getting 150 plus runs (222 not out) in the Irani Trophy final. The decision will be what's best for the team, but we'll certainly back all the guys in,"" he added. Pant, who did not keep wickets for a significant part of the opening Test, and Shubman Gill, who missed the match due to stiffness in his neck, are close to attaining their full fitness. ""Rishabh is pretty good. I think Rohit (Sharmna) touched on it the other day. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee.

Supreme Court says secularism a core part of the Constitution,"Published - October 21, 2024 09:33 pm IST - NEW DELHI A view of the Supreme Court of India in New Delhi | Photo Credit: Sushil Kumar Verma The Supreme Court on Monday (October 21, 2024) said secularism is an indelible and core part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. The court made the oral observation while hearing a batch of petitions filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy and others challenging the inclusion of words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble of the Constitution. “This court has in a number of judgments held that secularism was always part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution. If one looks right to equality and the word ‘fraternity’ used in the Constitution, there is a clear indication that secularism has been held as the core feature of the Constitution,” a Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar said. Justice Khanna disagreed with the petitioners’ argument that the term ‘socialism’ would curtail personal liberty and individualism. “One should not take the meaning adopted in Western countries… Socialism can also mean that there should be equality of opportunity and the wealth of the country should be distributed equally,” Justice Khanna remarked orally. Advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, a petitioner, said he was neither against the words “socialist, secular and integrity” nor their insertion in the Constitution but against the insertion of these words into the Preamble in 1976 and that too with a retrospective effect from November 26, 1949. The Preamble was amended in December 1976 by the Indira Gandhi government to introduce the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’. The phrase “unity of the nation” was replaced with “unity and integrity of the nation”. The changes were made in the Preamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment during the Emergency. Originally, the text of the Preamble declared India as a ‘sovereign, democratic republic’. The words ‘socialist’, ‘secular’ were inserted between ‘sovereign’ and ‘democratic’. The largest Bench in the history of the Supreme Court (13 judges) in the Kesavananda Bharati case had held that the Preamble was an integral part of the Constitution, and was subject to the amending power of the Parliament, provided the basic structure was not tinkered with. Advocate Sriram Parakkat, appearing for Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Binoy Viswam said the 42nd amendment was indeed “infamous”. It had after all tried to reduce the power of the Supreme Court and High Courts. “While subsequent amendments more or less restored the Constitution to what it was pre-1976, this change was made in the Preamble… that we are secular and socialist… was retained,” Mr. Parakkat submitted in court.

Kerala Police in Supreme Court seek custodial interrogation of actor Siddique,"Updated - October 22, 2024 06:35 am IST - NEW DELHI Veteran film actor Siddique comes out after appearing before a special investigation team for questioning in an alleged rape case, in Thiruvananthapuram, on October 7, 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI The Kerala Police have filed a report in the Supreme Court, urging custodial interrogation of Malayalam actor Siddique in a sexual assault case, saying it was “essential to expose his lie of righteousness before he goes down in history as a hero”. The State Police said there was a “stockpile of evidence” against Mr. Siddique, who was granted anticipatory bail by the top court in September. Opposing regular bail to Mr. Siddique, the police, represented by advocate Nishe Rajen Shonker, said any grant of leeway to the actor would be a blow to the policy of zero tolerance towards crimes against women and children. “The petitioner’s influence, the risk to the integrity of the investigation, and the broader public interest in cases involving crimes against women are strong grounds for opposing bail,” the report filed through Ajichandran Nair, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Narcotic Cell, Thiruvananthapuram City, submitted. The police said Siddique had a lookout notice issued against him on September 25. “The petitioner (Siddique) absconded. He re-surfaced only after a week once the Supreme Court granted interim protection. All this highlights the unwillingness of the accused to cooperate with the investigating agency, and also bide time to destroy evidence and turn circumstances in his favour,” the report filed on October 19 said. Mr. Siddique’s “willingness’ to cooperate with the investigation is limited to appearing before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) after the interim protection was granted by the Supreme Court. “However, he has not cooperated in the interrogation and [has] given evasive, contradictory and tutored answers to the police, citing forgetfulness, knowing fully well that he is under the interim protection of the Supreme Court. The custodial interrogation of the petitioner is vital to the case for unearthing the exact sequence of events that have unfolded in the last eight years, and also for recovery of the digital devices which the petitioner has used to contact the victim,” the police report said. The report said the actor had not shared details of his Facebook, Skype and other social media accounts, or electronic gadgets and vehicles used in the relevant period, in order to verify the communication between the victim and the petitioner. He had merely appeared on October 7, 2024 with a signed letter stating “the instruments which I had used earlier were discarded by me… these instruments have no relevance to your investigation”. “It is essential that the accused is in custody while the crucial investigation and evidence gathering is underway,” the police underscored. Also read | Malayalam cinema industry in turmoil: Tracking the fallout of the Hema Committee Report The report argued that the victim was 19 years old when she was first contacted by the accused in the case. She was 21 at the time of the alleged crime. The police contended that a mere delay in lodging the First Information Report (FIR) could be a ground by itself for throwing the entire prosecution case overboard. “In fact, the victim has time and again come out in social media alleging sexual harassment at the hands of the petitioner. These were outbursts of her trauma as stated by the victim. It is also valid to note that the statements of the psychologist and psychiatrist consulted by the victim has been recorded, and they have attested that the complainant is a victim of sexual abuse and has suffered trauma,” the report said.

HC grants interim bail to life convict in 1996 murder of medical student,"Published - October 21, 2024 10:58 pm IST - CHENNAI The Madras High Court on Monday granted interim bail to life convict M. John David involved in the 1996 murder of medical student Pon Navarasu. It also ordered the reconsideration of the Governor’s refusal to permit his premature release. A Division Bench of Justices S.M. Subramaniam and V. Sivagnanam disposed of a writ petition filed by his gynaecologist mother Esther and quashed a Government Order (G.O.) issued on May 8, 2024 by which the plea for premature release from prison was rejected for want of the Governor’s nod. The murder of the medical student, who was the son of the then University of Madras Vice-Chancellor P.K. Ponnuswamy, by severing his head following a ragging incident at the Muthiah Medical College Hostel in Annamalai University had created shockwaves across the State in 1996. The trial court had convicted the hostelmate in 1998 and sentenced him to life imprisonment. However, the High Court acquitted him in 2001 for want of evidence. After a prolonged legal battle, the Supreme Court reversed the acquittal and confirmed the conviction in 2011.

Coimbatore car blast | NIA arrests three men for funding attack,"Published - October 21, 2024 08:45 pm IST - COIMBATORE The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday arrested three persons for alleged involvement in the funding of the car blast that occurred in front of Sangameswarar temple at Kottaimedu in Coimbatore on October 23, 2022. A release from NIA said that it unearthed the terror financing angle in the case with the arrest of Aboo Hanifa, Saran Mariappan and Pavas Rahman, all hailing from Coimbatore, taking the total number of accused in the case to 18. NIA has filed four chargesheets against 14 accused before the Special Court for NIA cases at Poonamallee in Chennai in connection with the blast, in which a self-styled Islamic State operative and suicide bomber Jamesha Mubeen (29) was killed. According to the agency, investigations revealed that the three accused had colluded with one other to provide funds for the commission of the car blast. Hanifa had been working as a faculty in Kovai Arabic College, where Mubeen and other arrested accused persons got radicalised in the Islamic State ideology. Before carrying out the attack, Mubeen had sworn allegiance by giving ‘bayath’ to Abu-Al-Hasan Al-Hashimi Al-Qurashi, the then self-styled Calipha of the Islamic State, the agency said. It added that an offshoot case registered with respect to the radicalisation had separately led to the arrest and charge-sheeting of four accused by the NIA. Further investigation by the agency is on. Published - October 21, 2024 08:45 pm IST Coimbatore / crime / terrorism (crime) Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

"Hezbollah hides millions in cash, gold under Beirut hospital, says Israel","Updated - October 22, 2024 02:32 pm IST - JERUSALEM Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. File | Photo Credit: AP Hezbollah has stashed hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold in a bunker built under a hospital in Beirut, Israel's military said on Monday (October 21, 2024), adding it will not strike the facility as it keeps up attacks against the group's financial assets. Fadi Alameh, a Lebanese lawmaker with the Shi'ite Amal Movement party and the director of the hospital in question, Al-Sahel, told Reuters that Israel was making false and slanderous claims and called on the Lebanese Army to visit and show it only had operating rooms, patients and a morgue. ""Tonight, I am going to declassify intelligence on a site that we did not strike—where Hezbollah has millions of dollars in gold and cash—in Hassan Nasrallah's bunker. Where is the bunker located? Directly under Al-Sahel Hospital in the heart of Beirut.""

Reuters could not independently verify the details provided by the Israeli military's chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, which he said had been collected by Israeli intelligence for years. Hezbollah could not immediately be reached for comment. In a televised statement, Mr. Hagari said Hezbollah's former leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, whom Israel killed last month, had built the bunker which was designed for lengthy stays.

"'Rs 1,11,11,111 for Any Cop Who Kills Lawrence Bishnoi': This Outfit Has Announced Bounty for 'Encounter'","Curated By: Satyaki Baidya Translation Desk Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 11:59 IST Delhi, India Lawrence Bishnoi is currently incarcerated in Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati Jail, facing numerous charges, including murder, attempted murder and extortion. (News18 Hindi) The Kshatriya Karni Sena has reportedly announced a bounty of Rs 1,11,11,111 for the ‘encounter’ of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who was implicated in the recent murder of Maharashtra NCP leader Baba Siddique. According to Navbharat Times, Kshatriya Karni Sena president Raj Shekhawat said in a video statement that any police officer who kills Lawrence Bishnoi will be given a reward of Rs 1,11,11,111. Strongly criticizing the central and the Gujarat government, Shekhawat said that Lawrence Bishnoi is a threat to the country. In a video uploaded on social media, the Kshatriya Karni Sena chief said, “Lawrence Bishnoi has killed our precious gem and heritage Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi.” Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi was shot dead by unknown assailants in Jaipur on December 5, 2023. After a few hours, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang claimed responsibility for his murder. Earlier in September 2023, the gang had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Khalistani supporter Sukha Duneke. Lawrence Bishnoi was one of the persons named as accused in the FIR pertaining to the incident of firing outside Salman Khan’s Bandra residence in Mumbai in April. The animosity between Lawrence Bishnoi and Salman Khan first became public in 2018 when Bishnoi said during a court appearance in Jodhpur, “We will kill Salman Khan. Everyone will know once we take action. I have not done anything as of now, they are accusing me of crimes for no reason.” Since then, the popular actor has received multiple threats to his life. The enmity stems from the infamous blackbuck poaching case involving Salman Khan which took place in 1998 during the filming of Hum Saath-Saath Hain in Rajasthan, irking the Bishnoi community which revers the animal. Lawrence Bishnoi is currently incarcerated in Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati Jail, facing numerous charges, including murder, attempted murder, extortion, and drug and arms smuggling across various states.  A product of a gangster-terror network nexus, Lawrence Bishnoi has been named by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in several high-profile cases, including alleged his links with banned terror group Babbar Khalsa International, and smuggling of arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Despite the NIA taking significant steps towards dismantling his criminal network, he continues to execute his design through a large group of henchman and sharpshooters in several states, especially in the north and west of India.

NIA begins Kashmir attack probe; militants remain untraced,"Updated - October 21, 2024 11:22 pm IST - Srinagar Security personnel keep vigil around Gagangir forests after seven people killed in the ‘Gagangir terror attack’ last night, in Ganderbal on October 21, 2024 | Photo Credit: ANI Militants who killed seven civilians and injured five others and set vehicles on fire on Sunday at the campsite of a private construction company in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir are yet to be traced. A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday began the probe into the brutal killings. Security agencies have launched a manhunt for the terrorists. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha blamed Pakistan for the recent attacks saying the neighbouring country was frustrated by the successful and peaceful elections in Jammu and Kashmir, and people expressing their faith in democracy. Mr. Sinha said security forces and the police had been given instructions and full freedom to track down and eliminate the perpetrators. “I want to assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and the country, that we will soon track down these elements and punish them severely,” he said. A statement attributed to The Resistance Front (TRT), an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) outfit, claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the police have not confirmed the veracity of the purported statement. TRT claimed that its men “targeted a construction site where a billion-dollar tunnel project primarily intended for military transportation is underway”. Official sources said the targeted killings of non-locals “apparently seems very well planned”. Automatic rifles like INSAS were used to target the campsite in Ganderbal’s Gagangeer area. Preliminary investigation suggested that at least two vehicles of the company were set on fire on Sunday by the heavily armed militants who stormed the camp site of the APCO Infratech company, which is engaged in tunnel work from Gagangeer to Sonamarg in Ganderbal district. The tunnel is a key project to have an all-weather road between Srinagar and Ladakh, which otherwise remains cut off during peak winter seasons. The attack left seven construction workers, including technicians and a doctor, dead. Hundreds of locals participated in the last rites of Dr. Shahnawaz Dar, a resident of Budgam district. The killing has left the family shattered. “He was our lone bread earner. He wanted to see me as an IAS officer. All our dreams have shattered,” Mohsin Dar, son of the deceased doctor, said. The victim’s daughter was married off recently. Locals and relatives of the victims demanded action against the attackers. Mr. Sinha announced a relief of ₹6 lakh to the kin of the victims. An ex gratia of ₹2 lakh will be provided to the injured. Those injured in the attack included Inder Yadav, a labourer from Bihar; Madan Lal, an electrician from Kathua, Jammu; Mushtaq Ahmad Lone, a mess helper from Preng, Kangan, Kashmir; Ishfaq Ahmad Bhat, a driver from Safapora, Ganderbal; and Jagtar Singh, a labourer from Kathua, Jammu. Separatist Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the killings. “Islam strongly deplores such inhuman acts. Every life is precious, and to lose lives in this manner is extremely painful. The incident is a grim reminder of the unending cycle of violence and uncertainty that the people of the region have endured for decades,” the Mirwaiz said.

Ryan ten Doeschate Gives Fitness Update on Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill for Pune Test,"Curated By: Ritayan Basu News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 17:27 IST Pune, India Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant of the Indian Cricket Team. (Image: Sportzpics) India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said on Tuesday that he is hopeful that Rishabh Pant will be the wicketkeeper in the second Test against New Zealand after injuring his knee in the opener. Pant made a valiant 99 in the opening loss to the Kiwis, marking the visitors’ first Test victory in India since 1988. But while keeping wickets, he hurt the same knee that was operated on after a serious car crash in December 2022 that sidelined him for more than a year. His fitness remains in focus as the hosts look to level the three-match series in the Test starting Thursday in Pune. ALSO READ | Shubman Gill To Replace Sarfaraz Khan or KL Rahul? India’s Likely Playing XI For 2nd Test Against New Zealand “Rishabh is pretty good. I think Rohit (Sharmna) touched on it the other day. He was having a little bit of discomfort at the end range of his movement with the knee. But fingers crossed, he’ll be good to keep in the Test as well,” he said. “He (Gill) looks so (available for this Test). He has batted last week in Bangalore, he had a few nets, he’s got a little bit of discomfort, but I think he’ll be good to go for the Test,” he added. Pant, 27, has made a remarkable comeback from the night his Mercedes rammed into a barrier, flipped and caught fire near New Delhi. He was left with a damaged ligament in his right knee, a hurt wrist and ankle and abrasions to his back, and laboured through an intensive rehabilitation programme.

They (New Zealand) are filled with four left-handers in the XI. We’ve had Washy around the white-ball squad for a while and we like the way he operates. It’s also nice to see that guys are getting rewarded for Ranji Trophy performance as well.” “We just want to make sure we’re absolutely prepared for conditions here and if that does mean taking the ball away from the left-hander, we want that option,” he added.

Ranji Trophy: Karnataka vs Kerala,"Published - October 21, 2024 08:49 pm IST - BENGALURU: Rain played spoilsport in the Karnataka vs Kerala Ranji Trophy match | Photo Credit: N SUDARSHAN Karnataka and Kerala got a point each as their Ranji Trophy Elite Group-C encounter at the Alur Grounds ended in a frustrating draw after the final day’s play on Monday was also abandoned because of overnight rain. Of the 12 sessions in the match, there was action only in two — the final session on the opening day and the first session on the second. All of 50 overs’ play was possible, with Kerala reaching 161 for three. The solitary point will hurt Karnataka more than Kerala, for the eight-time champion had to be content with one point in its rain-curtailed opening tie against Madhya Pradesh as well. Kerala, on the other hand, secured a eight-wicket victory over Punjab in the first game, fetching the side six points. Karnataka will travel to Patna next to take on Bihar from October 26 while Kerala will clash with Bengal in Kolkata.

‘Do Not Fly From November 19': Khalistani Terrorist Pannun Issues Threat To Air India Passengers,"Curated By: Rohit News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 12:34 IST Washington D.C., United States of America (USA) On Friday, top intelligence sources told CNN-News18 that Pannun is running an immigration racket. (File photo/PTI) Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has threatened international flyers against boarding Air India flights ahead of the 40th anniversary of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Pannun, who is the founder of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), warned that “an attack could occur on an Air India flight” after November 19. Pannun, who holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada, has been designated a terrorist by the Ministry of Home Affairs since July 2020 on charges of sedition and secessionism. “Do not fly Air India. …We are asking the Sikh ‘panth’ not to fly via Air India. From November 19, there will be a global blockade. Air India won’t be allowed to operate. Sikh ‘panth’, don’t travel by Air India after November 19,” the SFJ founder said. Read More: From Threatening PM Modi to Asking Hindus to Leave US, Canada, How Pannun Has Been Spewing Venom Against India Pannun, also accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in multiple cases, is known for insulting the Indian flag and has even threatened Indian diplomats on several occasions. He had issued a similar threat around the same time last year. According to sources, Pannun misuses his access in the UK and Canada for spreading anti-India propaganda.  On Friday, top intelligence sources told CNN-News18 that Pannun is running an immigration racket and, looking at his strategy, Pakistan’s spy agency ISI is also in touch with him. “Initially he kept on denying his association with them but he later came out openly in London with Pakistan high commission’s Kashmir Day event,” said a source. “His idea is to instigate the youth of Punjab born after 1984 against India and atrocities on the Sikh community.” According to the sources, Pannun is getting funding from the ISI, some money from innocent youths, and some donations in the name of war. He has made many gurdwaras of the UK, US, and Canada breeding grounds for anti-India sentiments. Ganesha says to take care to maintain your reputation in society, but also try to help others.

Want Korean Glass Skin Without Breaking The Bank? Try These Simple Homemade Masks,"Published By: Nishad Thaivalappil Trending Desk Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 07:15 IST Mumbai, India Not only are these methods budget-friendly, but they also minimise the risk of irritation. (Representative Image) Skincare aficionados have long been fascinated by the trend of Korean glass skin. It’s a characterised by a flawless, radiant complexion that exudes a luminous glow with an almost translucent finish. But achieving this ethereal glow doesn’t always require a shopping spree through high-end beauty aisles. Instead, you can unlock this radiant look with easy, homemade techniques. Not only are these methods budget-friendly, but they also minimise the risk of irritation, allowing you to nurture your skin the natural way. Here are a few homemade face masks to get a glass-like glow on your face: Honey is known for its moisturising and antibacterial properties, while rice flour acts as a gentle exfoliator, removing dead skin cells. To make this mask, combine honey and rice flour in a small mixing bowl until they form a smooth paste. Spread the mixture evenly over your cleansed face, avoiding the eye area, and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes. Rinse gently with lukewarm water, then splash with cold water to tighten the pores. Green tea contains antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation, and yogurt has lactic acid, which gently exfoliates and brightens the skin. First, steep green tea leaves in hot water for a few minutes and let it cool. Then, combine the tea with yogurt until completely blended. Apply the mixture to your face and massage gently. Leave it on for 20-25 minutes and then rinse. Blend fresh aloe vera gel and shredded cucumber until the mixture is smooth. Generously apply the mixture to your face and neck and leave it on for 30 minutes. Rinse it off with cool water. Aloe vera is known for its soothing and moisturising properties, which can relieve irritated skin and retain moisture. Cucumber, on the other hand, is high in vitamins and minerals, providing a refreshing and cooling sensation.  Matcha tea powder contains antioxidants that combat free radicals. Mix matcha tea, honey, and almond oil into a smooth paste. Apply the mask evenly to your face and neck, and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Afterwards, rinse with lukewarm water.

Two men plead guilty to murder of Air India bombing suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik,"Advertisement OTTAWA: Two men accused of killing Ripudaman Singh Malik, a Sikh man acquitted in the 1985 Air India Kanishka terrorist bombing case, have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a Canadian court, according to media reports. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez entered the pleas in the British Columbia (BC) Supreme Court on Monday on the eve of their trial for the killing of 75-year-old Malik, who was shot several times outside his family business on the morning of July 14, 2022. Malik was shot dead in Surrey, British Columbia in 2022. He and co-accused Ajaib Singh Bagri were acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges related to the two bombings in 1985 that killed 331 people. In the court in New Westminster on Monday, both Fox and Lopez pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree murder, the Global News reported. The court heard an agreed statement of facts that revealed the two men had been hired to kill Malik, the report added. ""What we know from the agreed statement of facts is that there was some type of financial incentive that was involved in the commission of this crime, but in terms of any other specifics, it is another one of those situations where unfortunately it is just something that we as people on the outside will probably never know, Lopez' lawyer Gloria Ng told Global News. One of the things we certainly have in the forefront of our minds is the youth of our client Lopez is a very young man and we are certainly hopeful with prospects for rehabilitation. In a statement, Malik's family described him as a ""father, brother, husband and grandfather as well as a tireless community leader,"" the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Monday. ""While we are grateful that the shooters are being brought to justice, we know that nothing will erase the pain that we have gone through losing a family member in this way,"" the family said. ""However, the work is not complete. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez were hired to commit this murder. Until the parties responsible for hiring them and directing this assassination are brought to justice, the work remains incomplete. The family called on the killers to ""co-operate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in bringing those that hired you to justice. "" Crown and defence lawyers have agreed that Fox and Lopez should not be eligible for parole for 20 years. And they will next appear in court on October 31 for sentencing. The 1985 Air India bombing is among the worst terrorist attacks in Canadian history and in the history of the airline. On June 23, 1985, Air India flight 182, carrying 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens and 24 Indian citizens, flew from Toronto and stopped in Montreal from where it was en route to London and then onwards to its final destination Bombay. The plane was flying 31,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean when a suitcase bomb exploded in the front cargo, killing all on board. Another bomb was meant to be planted in an Air India flight scheduled to take off from Japan but it exploded at Tokyo's Narita airport killing two baggage handlers. Inderjit Singh Reyat was convicted on various charges and spent 30 years in prison for helping to make the bombs, and for lying during trials, including Malik's. He was released in 2016 after serving two-thirds of his perjury sentence. Reyat was the only person convicted for the Kanishka bombing.

Prithvi Shaw Dropped From Mumbai's Ranji Trophy Squad Due To Discipline And Fitness Issues – Report,"Curated By: Harshit Bisht News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 07:19 IST Mumbai, India Prithvi Shaw will miss Mumbai's third Ranji Trophy 2024-25 match against Tripura. (Picture Credit: PTI) Former India U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw was dropped from Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad on Monday (October 21) for the upcoming match against Tripura. The Ajinkya Rahane-led side, which defeated Maharashtra by nine wickets in the second Elite Group A match played in Mumbai on Monday, will travel to Agartala for the third match of the ongoing season, which starts on October 26. According to a report in Indian Express on Monday, Shaw, who became the youngest Indian batter to score a century on Test debut against the West Indies in 2018, was dropped by the Mumbai selection committee due to poor fitness. He has been asked by selectors to follow two weeks of a fitness programme prepared by MCA trainers. As per the available information, Mumbai team management informed MCA that Shaw’s body contains 35 percent fat and he needs rigorous training before he gets back into the side. “He has been dropped and needs to go back to training and shed some body weight to be considered for selection,” an MCA official was quoted as saying by Indian Express. Meanwhile, Cricbuzz has reported that the MCA selection committee, which comprises Sanjay Patil (chairman), Ravi Thaker, Jeetendra Thackeray, Kiran Powar, and Vikrant Yeligeti, felt that Shaw, who has a history of disciplinary issues, should be dropped for at least one game. The selectors and team management believe that the exclusion might serve as a lesson for Shaw, who apparently has been irregular to nets and practice sessions. The 25-year-old cricketer reportedly does not take net practice sessions seriously and attends them irregularly. He has been skipping sessions—sometimes missing two for every session he attends. According to a senior MCA source, both the selectors and the team management, including the captain and coach, were on the same page in their decision to leave Shaw out of the squad. Shaw played in the first two matches of the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 for Mumbai but was not able to do much with the bat. He scored 7 and 12 runs against Baroda and made 1 & 39 not out against Maharashtra. The right-handed opening batter was also part of the Mumbai team that won the Irani Cup 2024 match against the Rest of India in Lucknow at the start of this month. In that one-off match, he scored 4 and 76 runs. Shaw is replaced by left-handed opener Akhil Herwadkar, who has experience of playing in 41 Ranji matches. He, however, last played Ranji Trophy in 2022 for Chhattisgarh. Apart from Shaw, Suryakumar Yadav and spin bowling all-rounder Tanush Kotian will also not play in the match against Tripura. As per ESPNCricinfo, Surya was unavailable due to personal reasons, whereas Kotian was left out after he was named in the India A squad for the upcoming series against Australia A. In his place, 28-year-old left-arm spinner Karsh Kothari, whose previous appearance for Mumbai came in December 2018, was added to the squad. Squad: Ajinkya Rahane (C), Ayush Mhatre, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Akhil Herwadkar, Shreyas Iyer, Siddhesh Lad, Suryansh Shedge, Hardik Tamore (WK), Siddhant Addhatrao (WK), Shams Mulani, Karsh Kothari, Himanshu Singh, Shardul Thakur, Mohit Avasthi, Mohammad Juned Khan, Royston Dias",Curated By Harshit Bisht News18com Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 0719 IST Mumbai India Prithvi Shaw will miss Mumbais third Ranji Trophy 202425 match against Tripura Picture Credit PTI Former India U19 captain Prithvi Shaw was dropped from Mumbais Ranji Trophy squad on Monday October 21 for the upcoming match against Tripura The Ajinkya Rahaneled side which defeated Maharashtra by nine wickets in the second Elite Group A match played in Mumbai on Monday will travel to Agartala for the third match of the ongoing season which starts on October 26 According to a report in Indian Express on Monday Shaw who became the youngest Indian batter to score a century on Test debut against the West Indies in 2018 was dropped by the Mumbai selection committee due to poor fitness He has been asked by selectors to follow two weeks of a fitness programme prepared by MCA trainers As per the available information Mumbai team management informed MCA that Shaws body contains 35 percent fat and he needs rigorous training before he gets back into the side He has been dropped and needs to go back to training and shed some body weight to be considered for selection an MCA official was quoted as saying by Indian Express Meanwhile Cricbuzz has reported that the MCA selection committee which comprises Sanjay Patil chairman Ravi Thaker Jeetendra Thackeray Kiran Powar and Vikrant Yeligeti felt that Shaw who has a history of disciplinary issues should be dropped for at least one game The selectors and team management believe that the exclusion might serve as a lesson for Shaw who apparently has been irregular to nets and practice sessions The 25yearold cricketer reportedly does not take net practice sessions seriously and attends them irregularly He has been skipping sessionssometimes missing two for every session he attends According to a senior MCA source both the selectors and the team management including the captain and coach were on the same page in their decision to leave Shaw out of the squad Shaw played in the first two matches of the Ranji Trophy 202425 for Mumbai but was not able to do much with the bat He scored 7 and 12 runs against Baroda and made 1  39 not out against Maharashtra The righthanded opening batter was also part of the Mumbai team that won the Irani Cup 2024 match against the Rest of India in Lucknow at the start of this month In that oneoff match he scored 4 and 76 runs Shaw is replaced by lefthanded opener Akhil Herwadkar who has experience of playing in 41 Ranji matches He however last played Ranji Trophy in 2022 for Chhattisgarh Apart from Shaw Suryakumar Yadav and spin bowling allrounder Tanush Kotian will also not play in the match against Tripura As per ESPNCricinfo Surya was unavailable due to personal reasons whereas Kotian was left out after he was named in the India A squad for the upcoming series against Australia A In his place 28yearold leftarm spinner Karsh Kothari whose previous appearance for Mumbai came in December 2018 was added to the squad Squad Ajinkya Rahane C Ayush Mhatre Angkrish Raghuvanshi Akhil Herwadkar Shreyas Iyer Siddhesh Lad Suryansh Shedge Hardik Tamore WK Siddhant Addhatrao WK Shams Mulani Karsh Kothari Himanshu Singh Shardul Thakur Mohit Avasthi Mohammad Juned Khan Royston Dias,Toxic

Not Rishabh Pant's 89 at Gabba! Pat Cummins Names This Indian Legend's Knock as Most Memorable in IND vs AU,"Curated By: Amar Sunil Panicker News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 23:21 IST New Delhi, India Pat Cummins and Rishabh Pant will face off during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024 in Australia. (Image: AFP) The Australian skipper, Pat Cummins was quizzed regarding the most memorable knock that comes to mind in the IND-AUS rivalry. Surprisingly, the 31-year-old fast-bowler did not pick Rishabh Pant’s iconic knock where he scored an unbeaten 89 at the Gabba to help India claim the series win. The fast-bowler in an interview with Star Sports, rolled back the years as he named Sachin Tendulkar’s then-highest Test score of 241 not out against the Aussies at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in January 2004. Tendulkar at the time was under pressure with a string of low scores and the Master Blaster came up with a simple yet effective solution to find himself back amongst the runs. At the time he was being dismissed via an edge outside the off-stump line and to nullify this possibility, the Indian batting great decided to take an extreme call of not playing anything outside the off-stump line. That innings saw Sachin play his shots either straight down the ground or towards the leg side. An effective solution which ended up breaking his 15-month-long drought of not scoring a Test century. When the effort looks so superhuman, it must be @sachin_rt! @patcummins30 talks about Sachin’s 241* without cover drives, which defined patience and discipline at their best! Watch #AUSvINDOnStar starting FRI, 22 NOV onwards! #AUSvIND | #ToughestRivalry pic.twitter.com/Yz6ijLKTur — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) October 21, 2024  The legendary batter’s knock could prove to be an inspiration for the current crop of players who will make the trip Down Under where they hope to see the Indian side go all the way and make it a third series victory in a row in Australian soil. However, Cummins and the rest of the Australian squad will be no pushovers as they aim to establish their dominance at home and reclaim the BGT 2024 title after a decade. The Australian side will look to bring in their A-game with the fast-bowling unit being the key players to watch out for in the upcoming clash. They will also take notes from Sachin’s legendary knock to ensure that such instances do not reoccur in the coming bout between two of the toughest sides in modern cricket. In addition, they will also certainly keep a close eye on Pant to ensure that he is not able to have the hero’s moment as he did at the Gabba in 2021.",Curated By Amar Sunil Panicker News18com Last Updated OCTOBER 21 2024 2321 IST New Delhi India Pat Cummins and Rishabh Pant will face off during the BorderGavaskar Trophy 2024 in Australia Image AFP The Australian skipper Pat Cummins was quizzed regarding the most memorable knock that comes to mind in the INDAUS rivalry Surprisingly the 31yearold fastbowler did not pick Rishabh Pants iconic knock where he scored an unbeaten 89 at the Gabba to help India claim the series win The fastbowler in an interview with Star Sports rolled back the years as he named Sachin Tendulkars thenhighest Test score of 241 not out against the Aussies at the Sydney Cricket Ground SCG in January 2004 Tendulkar at the time was under pressure with a string of low scores and the Master Blaster came up with a simple yet effective solution to find himself back amongst the runs At the time he was being dismissed via an edge outside the offstump line and to nullify this possibility the Indian batting great decided to take an extreme call of not playing anything outside the offstump line That innings saw Sachin play his shots either straight down the ground or towards the leg side An effective solution which ended up breaking his 15monthlong drought of not scoring a Test century When the effort looks so superhuman it must be sachinrt patcummins30 talks about Sachins 241 without cover drives which defined patience and discipline at their best Watch AUSvINDOnStar starting FRI 22 NOV onwards AUSvIND  ToughestRivalry pictwittercomYz6ijLKTur  Star Sports StarSportsIndia October 21 2024  The legendary batters knock could prove to be an inspiration for the current crop of players who will make the trip Down Under where they hope to see the Indian side go all the way and make it a third series victory in a row in Australian soil However Cummins and the rest of the Australian squad will be no pushovers as they aim to establish their dominance at home and reclaim the BGT 2024 title after a decade The Australian side will look to bring in their Agame with the fastbowling unit being the key players to watch out for in the upcoming clash They will also take notes from Sachins legendary knock to ensure that such instances do not reoccur in the coming bout between two of the toughest sides in modern cricket In addition they will also certainly keep a close eye on Pant to ensure that he is not able to have the heros moment as he did at the Gabba in 2021,Toxic

"Political spotlight turns to Wayanad, with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arriving to kick off her LS by-election campaign","Updated - October 22, 2024 12:45 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram:  Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra with party President Mallikarjun Kharge. | Photo Credit: ANI The political spotlight seemed to swivel towards the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala on Tuesday (October 22, 2024).  Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will arrive in the district later in the day to kick off her inaugural foray into electoral politics. Also read | Priyanka Gandhi’s entry in Wayanad bypoll may be a gamechanger for Congress-led UDF in 2026 Kerala Assembly polls Her brother and Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament, Rahul Gandhi, is accompanying Ms. Vadra.  On October 23, Ms. Vadra will file the nomination papers for the seat vacated by Mr. Gandhi after he won simultaneously from the Rae Bareilly LS segment in Uttar Pradesh.  When bowing out from Wayanad, Mr. Gandhi had promised to maintain his “familial bond” with the electorate. Subsequently, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) nominated Ms. Vadra as the party’s candidate from Wayanad.  Mr. Gandhi’s victory margin dwindled by an estimated 5.25% when he faced Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Annie Raja and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) State President K. Surendran in 2024 compared to his thumping victory in the 2019 Wayanad LS polls. The Congress and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), which has a significant presence in the Wayanad district, have scheduled a high-decibel road show in Kalpettah to present Ms Vadra to the electorate. AICC national president Mallikarjun Kharge and Mr. Gandhi will participate in the rally, along with KPCC and IUML leaders.  Scores of posters welcoming Ms. Vadra have appeared across the Wayanad district. Ms. Vadra, who campaigned for Mr. Gandhi in Wayanad in 2019 and later in 2024, has reportedly developed close links with local leaders and the electorate. The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) has fielded Communist Party of India (CPI) veteran Sathyan Mokeri as its candidate in the Wayanad LS by-election. The CPI has been openly critical of Ms. Vadra’s candidature, stating that it ran against the grain of the INDIA Bloc’s political programme.  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has named the State general secretary of the Mahila Morcha, Navya Haridas, a software engineer, as its candidate in Wayanad. BJP State President K. Surendran, who fought Mr Gandhi and Ms Annie Raja in the Lok Sabha polls, had upped the NDA’s vote share in the Wayanad constituency by 5.75 per cent. The by-election campaign for the Wayanad LS constituency will unfold against the looming shadow of the catastrophic landslide that killed an estimated 400 sleeping residents in Chooralmala and Mundakkai villages early on July 30.  The ruling and opposition fronts have made the Centre’s alleged delay in dispersing aid for Wayanad as their central campaign plank. On October 14, the Kerala Legislative Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution demanding that the Central government release the aid urgently.  The Assembly also sought the Centre’s urgent intervention to persuade the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to write off the debt incurred by the disaster-hit people.

Karnataka HC dismisses PIL against Rahul Gandhi,"Advertisement BENGALURU: The Karnataka High Court on Monday rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking an apology from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for allegedly tarnishing the dignity of Indian women. A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice K Aravind dismissed the petition filed by the All India Dalit Action Committee, stating that it was a waste of judicial time, and imposed a Rs-25,000 fine on the petitioner. The petition claimed that Gandhi had falsely accused former MP Prajwal Revanna of raping 400 women and filming the act, and called it “mass rape” and not a sex scandal. The petitioner’s counsel argued that Gandhi’s remarks, made during a public speech, were highly irresponsible and offensive, particularly to the women of Hassan. The petition also stated that Gandhi’s allegations, made without evidence, misled the public and disrespected Indian women. The high court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it along with a fine, noting that the matter did not warrant further consideration.

Supreme Court extends pre-arrest bail for Malayalam actor Siddique in sexual assault case,"Updated - October 22, 2024 02:18 pm IST - NEW DELHI Veteran film actor Siddique. File. | Photo Credit: PTI The Supreme Court on Tuesday (October 22, 2024) extended the interim anticipatory bail granted to Malayalam actor Siddique in a sexual assault case. A Bench headed by Justice Bela Trivedi scheduled the case after two weeks following a request made by senior advocate V. Giri, for Mr. Siddique, seeking more time to file a response to a Kerala police report seeking his custodial interrogation. Also read: Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes | AMMA’s moment of reckoning Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said Mr. Siddique was unwilling to cooperate with the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case. The SIT is currently investigating over 30 FIRs registered across Kerala after the Justice Hema Commission report blew the lid off the “shocking and rampant” sexual harassment in the Malayalam film industry. The committee had found that the “general issue faced by women are sexual demands made to women for the very entry into cinema and for getting chances to work in cinema”.  The police report, filed through Kerala State counsel Nishe Rajen Shonker, referred to the Justice Hema Committee findings “that many perpetrators are powerful and very influential. The powerful lobby in the film industry is like a mafia since it could do anything according to its whims and fancies. No man or woman dares to utter any word which may offend anyone belonging to the power group”. When the Bench, which had initially given interim relief to Mr. Siddique in September, said the victim had delayed filing the complaint, Mr. Kumar said the balance of power was completely tilted against the woman. The State police said the woman was threatened by Mr. Siddique immediately after the incident. “She was told that nobody would even believe her since she was a nobody and he had a high profile stature. Further, the victim had seen him in the public domain and social media with powerful politicians and socially influential people. She was sceptical whether anyone would believe or support her if she spoke out at that time,” the police report explained. The police said she was subject to cyber-bullying and threats. She had mustered the courage to come out of her shell after the Justice Hema Committee report. The Kerala police said it was “essential to expose his [Siddique] lie of righteousness before he goes down in history as a hero” and added there was a “stockpile of evidence” against Mr. Siddique. The police said Mr. Siddique had a lookout notice issued against him on September 25. “He re-surfaced after a week once the Supreme Court granted him interim protection,” the report said. Mr. Siddique’s “willingness’ to cooperate with the investigation was limited to appearing before the SIT. “However, he has not cooperated in the interrogation and has given evasive, contradictory and tutored answers to the police, citing forgetfulness, knowing fully well that he is under the interim protection of the Supreme Court,” the police report said. The report said the actor had not shared details of his Facebook, Skype and other social media accounts, electronic gadgets and vehicles used in the relevant period.

"Ranji Trophy | Kotian will be missed more as a batter, says Mulani","Published - October 21, 2024 05:57 pm IST - Mumbai Dynamic duo: Mulani and Kotian have been instrumental in Mumbai’s success over the past three years. | Photo Credit: FILE PHOTO: EMMANUAL YOGINI Be it with an old ball in hand or while gripping the willow, there has been a solid partnership over the last three seasons for Mumbai. Tanush Kotian and Shams Mulani – the all-rounder duo – have been instrumental in Mumbai making it to the Ranji Trophy final twice in the last three campaigns, including the triumphant last season. However, the trusted combination will be broken for the next three rounds since Kotian – the right-hander – will leave for Australia along with the India A squad. Mulani, the senior partner, admitted that he will miss Kotian, the batter, more than the bowler. “We have been bowling together and doing well together but with the replacements we have, I am sure Himanshu (Singh) and I can also deliver in tandem,” Mulani said after Mumbai completed a nine-wicket win against Maharashtra. “All the best to Tanush, it’s a huge opportunity to represent India A. I will not miss him that much (with the ball) but definitely will miss him as a batter.” Mulani stated that getting the win was crucial – personally for him and the group – after a disappointing loss against Baroda last week. “We reflected pretty hard on the loss. We went through the video footage extensively. Some people took responsibility for the loss. It is very nice for our side when the seniors club in and the others raise take responsibility. It feels nice with the way we bounced back on the first morning here that set the game up for us,” said Mulani.

"Sexual harassment rampant in Maharashtra medical colleges, finds survey","Updated - October 22, 2024 04:16 pm IST - CHENNAI Most of the complaints reported from different institutions involved the same type of harassment, implying that these issues were common to almost every institution, and were not limited to any one college. Photograph used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto A research paper on a survey of 308 students across 28 medical colleges in Maharashtra has revealed that gender discrimination and sexual harassment is rampant on these campuses. The paper, ‘Attitudes and perceptions of undergraduate medical students about sexual harassment and gender discrimination: A survey-based study’ by Harleen Kaur et al, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics last week. It revealed that 43.2% of the students surveyed had faced some form of gender discrimination/sexual harassment, when asked specifically -- a wide range of these instances were described by the students in the questionnaires they filled out for the survey. It also found there was a lack of awareness, leading to these incidents being considered “part and parcel” of the MBBS curriculum, highlighting the need for more awareness. When probed, 42.5% of students reported that they were afraid to report such events, while 62.7% felt that reporting such events could negatively affect their grades and future career prospects suggesting that such events are under-reported and that there is a need for greater focus in this area, the survey pointed out. Sexual harassment and gender discrimination can lead to both physical and psychological problems such as anxiety, depression and social isolation. Disruptive workplace behaviour has been shown to have a dire impact on team collaboration and communication efficiency, leading to diminished staff performance and morale, the paper said. Most of the complaints reported from different institutions involved the same type of harassment, implying that these issues were common to almost every institution, and were not limited to any one college. Perpetrators included professors, including heads of departments, senior students, batch-mates, resident doctors and non-teaching staff, including hospital workers and hostel wardens. Victims reported that the harassment was commonly by individuals with “higher authority” and “higher seniority” -- underscoring unequal power dynamics in sexual harassment. Also Read: Kolkata doctor rape and murder case: A timeline of events Both men and women experienced sexual harassment. Incidents ranged from verbal harassment and sexist jokes to being touched inappropriately, being groped, as well as discrimination in hostel food and facilities.

"Security Beefed Up at J&K's Infra Projects After Terror Attack, Sites With More Labourers to See Stricter M","Reported By: Ankur Sharma Edited By: Apoorva Misra News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 11:35 IST Jammu and Kashmir, India Security personnel check vehicles on Srinagar-Ladakh highway during a search operation following a terrorist attack in Ganderbal district in J&K. (PTI) In a high-level meeting in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday evening, all agencies were instructed to enhance the security of infrastructure projects that are under construction. Sufficient deployments and technical surveillance will be implemented at all such sites. After a long gap, terrorists have begun targeting civilians in Jammu, shifting their focus from attacking civilians and security personnel in Kashmir. According to a senior official, DGP J&K Nalin Prabhat chaired a meeting on Monday with all stakeholders, where it was decided that security measures would be heightened at all construction sites, especially those involving national projects. Sources said that focus will also be on strengthening technical surveillance and access control. “There are multiple projects underway in J&K. It has been decided to immediately beef up security at these sites. Additionally, CCTV coverage and strict access control will be implemented,” a senior official deployed in J&K told News18. Apart from urging all forces to remain on high alert, the DGP also emphasised monitoring vehicle movements and exits to prevent terrorists from escaping after executing attacks. Sites with a large number of labourers will see deployments of security forces, and access will be restricted to authorised personnel only. Central Kashmir has a limited number of sites with large labour populations, while other parts of Kashmir have more such sites. Another focus area will be Jammu where multiple projects are going on and labourers are working and living in nearby areas. Seven people were killed on Sunday when terrorists opened fire on a camp housing workers from a private company engaged in constructing the Z-Mohr tunnel in the Gund area, which connects Gagangir to Sonamarg in Central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district. Security personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), along with local police, cordoned off the area. Teams from the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the premier agency investigating terror attacks, also rushed to the scene. The attack was orchestrated by the terrorist group The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which claimed responsibility for the killings. Sources reported that at least two unidentified terrorists carried out the attack, targeting the labourers and other staff as they returned to their camp after working on the tunnel project.",Reported By Ankur Sharma Edited By Apoorva Misra News18com Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 1135 IST Jammu and Kashmir India Security personnel check vehicles on SrinagarLadakh highway during a search operation following a terrorist attack in Ganderbal district in JK PTI In a highlevel meeting in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday evening all agencies were instructed to enhance the security of infrastructure projects that are under construction Sufficient deployments and technical surveillance will be implemented at all such sites After a long gap terrorists have begun targeting civilians in Jammu shifting their focus from attacking civilians and security personnel in Kashmir According to a senior official DGP JK Nalin Prabhat chaired a meeting on Monday with all stakeholders where it was decided that security measures would be heightened at all construction sites especially those involving national projects Sources said that focus will also be on strengthening technical surveillance and access control There are multiple projects underway in JK It has been decided to immediately beef up security at these sites Additionally CCTV coverage and strict access control will be implemented a senior official deployed in JK told News18 Apart from urging all forces to remain on high alert the DGP also emphasised monitoring vehicle movements and exits to prevent terrorists from escaping after executing attacks Sites with a large number of labourers will see deployments of security forces and access will be restricted to authorised personnel only Central Kashmir has a limited number of sites with large labour populations while other parts of Kashmir have more such sites Another focus area will be Jammu where multiple projects are going on and labourers are working and living in nearby areas Seven people were killed on Sunday when terrorists opened fire on a camp housing workers from a private company engaged in constructing the ZMohr tunnel in the Gund area which connects Gagangir to Sonamarg in Central Kashmirs Ganderbal district Security personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force CRPF along with local police cordoned off the area Teams from the National Investigation Agency NIA the premier agency investigating terror attacks also rushed to the scene The attack was orchestrated by the terrorist group The Resistance Front TRF an offshoot of LashkareTaiba LeT which claimed responsibility for the killings Sources reported that at least two unidentified terrorists carried out the attack targeting the labourers and other staff as they returned to their camp after working on the tunnel project,Toxic
'Will Continue Campaigning For Khalistani Referendum': Terrorist Pannun To Canadian Media,"Curated By: Vani Mehrotra News18.com Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 09:26 IST New Delhi, India Gurpatwant Singh Pannun (PTI photo) Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has said he is “not afraid” of any threats coming his way and will continue to campaign for the Khalistan referendum. He also has referred to India’s former High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma, as a “hypocrite”. Days after Verma was recalled after Canada said senior diplomats were “persons of interest” in the Hardeep Singh Nijjar murder probe, Pannun, in an interview with Canada-based CTV News, said he was confident that more evidence will come to light in connection with his and Nijjar’s case. “I’m not afraid of any threats, and I’m not going to stop campaigning for the global Khalistan referendum,” Pannun told CTV News on October 21. “Verma is less of a diplomat and more of a hypocrite. What needs to be done is to decimate and dismantle the spy network, which they have built under Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Verma,” the Khalistani separatist alleged during the interview. “These Vancouver and Toronto Indian consulates are the hub of the spy network,” he added. “Until these two consulates are permanently closed, they will keep on assassinating and challenging Canadian sovereignty.” After he was recalled, Sanjay Kumar Verma, also during an interview with CTV News, on October 20 said the Justin Trudeau government in Canada encourages Khalistani extremists “all the time”. “This is my allegation, I also know that some of these Khalistani extremists and terrorists are deep assets of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), again I’m not giving any evidence,” he said. Verma also denied any wrongdoing or involvement in Nijjar’s murder and reiterated that the Canadian government had not handed over “a shred of evidence” to the Indian government. On being asked about the former Indian envoy’s statement, Pannun accused the diplomat of giving “deceitful and deceptive responses”, and claimed he was confident more evidence would come to light connecting his case and Nijjar’s. Pannun, who holds dual citizenship of the US and Canada, has been designated a terrorist by the Ministry of Home Affairs since July 2020 on charges of sedition and secessionism. The assassination bid on Pannun was foiled in June last year following the arrest of another co-conspirator in the case, Nikhil Gupta, who is presently lodged in a US prison after his extradition from the Czech Republic. According to news agency PTI, Vikash Yadav, a former Indian government official charged by the US authorities for his alleged role in a foiled plot to assassinate Pannun on American soil, was arrested by Delhi Police in December last year in an unrelated extortion and kidnapping case. Quoting police sources, PTI reported that the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested Yadav (39) on December 18, 2023, for allegedly kidnapping a businessman living in Rohini and demanding money in the name of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. He was granted bail in April this year. The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following Trudeau’s allegations in September last year of the “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India, who was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Canada’s Surrey on June 18, 2023. New Delhi rejected Trudeau’s charges as “absurd”. Following Ottawa’s fresh allegations of the Indian government’s involvement in Nijjar’s killing, New Delhi expelled Canadian Charge d’Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats. The Canadian diplomats left New Delhi on the evening of October 18. India also recalled its High Commissioner and five more diplomats. Meanwhile, the Canadian government said the Indian diplomats were expelled from the country. During his latest media briefing, Trudeau, referring to findings by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), claimed that it has “clear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in, and continue to engage in, activities that pose a significant threat to public safety.” “This includes clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour targeting South Asian Canadians, and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder. This is unacceptable,” he alleged. The Canadian Prime Minister said his government’s attempts to work with India did not yield any result.

Why Does Kshatriya Karni Sena Want Lawrence Bishnoi Dead?,"Curated By: Satyaki Baidya Translation Desk Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 15:42 IST Rajasthan, India Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi was murdered by gangster Rohit Godara after becoming a target of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in 2017. (News18 Hindi) The recent bounty announcement by the Kshatriya Karni Sena president Raj Shekhawat for any policeman who ‘encounters’ Lawrence Bishnoi, currently in Sabarmati Jail, raises the question of why the group is targeting the notorious gangster. On December 5, 2023, shooters from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang arrived in Jaipur’s Shyamnagar and shot dead Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, firing a total of 17 rounds. In 2020, Rohit Godara of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang had threatened to kill Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, calling him from multiple international numbers. In March 2023, Gogamedi requested police protection, but it was not provided. Gogamedi was murdered by gangster Rohit Godara after becoming a target of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in 2017. In 2017, gangster Anandpal Singh was killed in a police encounter. Gogamedi gained attention by staging a 15-day dharna with Singh’s body. Over time, he began forming an organization for Rajput upliftment, which drew the ire of Rohit Godara. Gogamedi was a Rajput, while Godara was a Jat. Godara believed that Gogamedi always favored Rajputs. This led him to plot Gogamedi’s murder. Godara planned the murder meticulously for six months. Godara hired Naveen Rathore, an acquaintance who frequently visited Gogamedi’s home, and recruited Nitin Fauji as the second shooter. Fauji had joined the Karni Sena just six months earlier. A video from the day of the murder went viral on social media. On December 5, the trio visited Gogamedi under the pretext of delivering a wedding card. While Godara and Fauji were sitting in front, Rathore sat beside Gogamedi. The shooters shared tea with him in the dining hall before engaging in small talk. To Gogamedi’s shock, the assailants shot him 17 times inside the house. Rohit Godara also shot Rathore. This incident ignited the ongoing enmity between the Karni Sena and the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Lawrence Bishnoi is currently incarcerated in Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati Jail, facing numerous charges, including murder, attempted murder, extortion, and drug and arms smuggling across various states. A product of a gangster-terror network nexus, Lawrence Bishnoi has been named by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in several high-profile cases, including alleged his links with banned terror group Babbar Khalsa International, and smuggling of arms and ammunition from Pakistan. Despite the NIA taking significant steps towards dismantling his criminal network, he continues to execute his design through a large group of henchman and sharpshooters in several states, especially in the north and west of India.",Curated By Satyaki Baidya Translation Desk Last Updated OCTOBER 22 2024 1542 IST Rajasthan India Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi was murdered by gangster Rohit Godara after becoming a target of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in 2017 News18 Hindi The recent bounty announcement by the Kshatriya Karni Sena president Raj Shekhawat for any policeman who encounters Lawrence Bishnoi currently in Sabarmati Jail raises the question of why the group is targeting the notorious gangster On December 5 2023 shooters from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang arrived in Jaipurs Shyamnagar and shot dead Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi firing a total of 17 rounds In 2020 Rohit Godara of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang had threatened to kill Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi calling him from multiple international numbers In March 2023 Gogamedi requested police protection but it was not provided Gogamedi was murdered by gangster Rohit Godara after becoming a target of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in 2017 In 2017 gangster Anandpal Singh was killed in a police encounter Gogamedi gained attention by staging a 15day dharna with Singhs body Over time he began forming an organization for Rajput upliftment which drew the ire of Rohit Godara Gogamedi was a Rajput while Godara was a Jat Godara believed that Gogamedi always favored Rajputs This led him to plot Gogamedis murder Godara planned the murder meticulously for six months Godara hired Naveen Rathore an acquaintance who frequently visited Gogamedis home and recruited Nitin Fauji as the second shooter Fauji had joined the Karni Sena just six months earlier A video from the day of the murder went viral on social media On December 5 the trio visited Gogamedi under the pretext of delivering a wedding card While Godara and Fauji were sitting in front Rathore sat beside Gogamedi The shooters shared tea with him in the dining hall before engaging in small talk To Gogamedis shock the assailants shot him 17 times inside the house Rohit Godara also shot Rathore This incident ignited the ongoing enmity between the Karni Sena and the Lawrence Bishnoi gang Lawrence Bishnoi is currently incarcerated in Ahmedabads Sabarmati Jail facing numerous charges including murder attempted murder extortion and drug and arms smuggling across various states A product of a gangsterterror network nexus Lawrence Bishnoi has been named by the National Investigation Agency NIA in several highprofile cases including alleged his links with banned terror group Babbar Khalsa International and smuggling of arms and ammunition from Pakistan Despite the NIA taking significant steps towards dismantling his criminal network he continues to execute his design through a large group of henchman and sharpshooters in several states especially in the north and west of India,Toxic
India’s gains with conciliatory security in J&K,"Advertisement Omar Abdullah has once again ascended the hot seat as the head of J&K government through a transparent, free and credible electoral process. Many have commented to say it was immaterial who came to power in J&K. That such an electoral process could be carried out in a proxy war zone without an incident of violence or repoll is itself a certification of what the nation has achieved. There are times when we need to sit back and observe what we did right without too much critiquing and negativising, notwithstanding the attack at Z-Morh which is an after event. Most striking is the fact that whenever the international community intercedes in conflicts around the world, it aims at a drawdown among the contestants, then an election, to get a people’s elected government in the seat of power. It’s not often this happens successfully and if it does, it rarely lasts. Cambodia and Mozambique were two good examples of UN interventions and both had an Indian peacekeeping presence. The recent parliamentary and assembly elections in J&K need to be examined from the angle of the success of the Indian model of conflict management, which betters almost all other models. We rarely give ourselves credit for this, but it’s not any one agency or domain that has succeeded in achieving what may have at one time appeared as an impossible task; it’s the Indian system and its conciliatory approach that many are critical of. Consider the environment we faced in 1989-90. A cascading insurgency sponsored from across the borders that moved into the realm of terror, a virtual genocidal eviction of a minority with a helpless administration looking on, atrocities aflush, mountain infiltration routes converted to highways, and the populace in the streets baying for the blood of soldiers and policemen. A gleeful adversary watching its handiwork succeed beyond expectations, with half its army sitting in deployment areas in a massive exercise called Zarb-e-Momin. This was January-February 1990. We inducted untrained troops and used brute power, all necessary if the fires had to be doused. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA-1990) was legislated to give additional powers to central forces. It remains in place as a contentious instrument used by anti-national forces as a propaganda tool. We resisted that right through and maintained the empowerment of the Army, without which the task would have been well nigh impossible. We defeated the early phases of the local uprising but, could do little against the rising alienation. The adversary inducted foreign terrorists in hundreds along the infiltration highways. We then raised a counter-insurgency (CI) and counter-terrorism (CT) force drawn from the Army itself and called it the Rashtriya Rifles (RR), one of our boldest military experiments. It succeeded due to the permanence it brought to the CI and CT grid, where earlier units were turning over even before they settled in. This domain of military and quasi-military operations needed permanence for stabilisation. The Jammu & Kashmir Police gained more experience by the day and proved as effective and loyal as any other. It raised the Special Operations Group, which worked closely with the RR, giving it the local advantage and hence force-multiplying intelligence. Later, the Army went and raised the Territorial Army (Home & Hearth) units, with the sons of the soil concept that helped in direct outreach to villages and small towns as our influence operations. The local Army regiment, the J&K Light Infantry provided liaison and outreach facilitation through local soldiers, many of whom also suffered the consequences. Quite early, the senior hierarchy realised that the proxy war could not be controlled without considering the local population as the centre of gravity. The years 1996-97 were crucial . We fought back against international efforts to label us undemocratic and violators of human rights. The 1996 elections and the government that came to office was an appropriate message to the world on India’s narrative on how such situations would be handled. In 1997, the Supreme Court handed to the Army a set of dos and don’ts in the conduct of operations under AFSPA. Simultaneously, we launched Operation Sadbhavana, a military civic action programme to assist the local administration in development work and outreach to people where the writ of terrorism prevailed. Under this, 43 goodwill schools and hundreds of joint Army-civil medical camps, cataract camps, aspirational tours to the rest of India, youth empowerment, sports schemes and so much more were organised. This led to the humanisation of conflict conditions. It all militated against the allegations of human rights violations. This was an approach rarely followed in hybrid war conditions anywhere else in the world except perhaps the British model in handling the Malayan Emergency. Surges in terrorism and the adoption of new models such as ‘agitational terror’ were controlled with minimum force. The Army was hardly ever employed except in search operations. With the realisation that the terror ecosystem that sustained the proxy war needed doses of neutralisation, Indian agencies went after terror financing networks and many other such systems related to media, drugs, radicalisation, overground workers, recruitment and separatist ideologues, which broke the back of terrorism, especially after 2017. The transformation from the concept of counting terrorists to counting the number of systems and networks neutralised gave a telling blow to the sponsors of proxy war. Five years after using the legislative and constitutional route to bring J&K into the Indian mainstream, the nation risked everything by holding elections. Even as the forces of revival were raising their head and Pakistan’s relevance is being re-sought through the Jammu route and now by attack on infrastructure, the Indian government decided to repeat 1996 and announced to the world that J&K would have the democratic choice to elect its own government. The new government may feel peeved at its relative disempowerment. In due course, powers will return, as will statehood, but much will depend on the ability to sustain the success we have progressively made. While the world agonises over the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, India’s example is one of a shining beacon in the murky world of conflict management where its interests will need to be permanently secured.

it was immaterial who came to power in JK That such an electoral process could be carried out in a proxy war zone without an incident of violence or repoll is itself a certification of what the nation has achieved There are times when we need to sit back and observe what we did right without too much critiquing and negativising notwithstanding the attack at ZMorh which is an after event Most striking is the fact that whenever the international community intercedes in conflicts around the world it aims at a drawdown among the contestants then an election to get a peoples elected government in the seat of power Its not often this happens successfully and if it does it rarely lasts Cambodia and Mozambique were two good examples of UN interventions and both had an Indian peacekeeping presence The recent parliamentary and assembly elections in JK need to be examined from the angle of the success of the Indian model of conflict management which betters almost all other models We rarely give ourselves credit for this but its not any one agency or domain that has succeeded in achieving what may have at one time appeared as an impossible task its the Indian system and its conciliatory approach that many are critical of Consider the environment we faced in 198990 A cascading insurgency sponsored from across the borders that moved into the realm of terror a virtual genocidal eviction of a minority with a helpless administration looking on atrocities aflush mountain infiltration routes converted to highways and the populace in the streets baying for the blood of soldiers and policemen A gleeful adversary watching its handiwork succeed beyond expectations with half its army sitting in deployment areas in a massive exercise called ZarbeMomin This was JanuaryFebruary 1990 We inducted untrained troops and used brute power all necessary if the fires had to be doused The Armed Forces Special Powers Act AFSPA1990 was legislated to give additional powers to central forces It remains in place as a contentious instrument used by antinational forces as a propaganda tool We resisted that right through and maintained the empowerment of the Army without which the task would have been well nigh impossible We defeated the early phases of the local uprising but could do little against the rising alienation The adversary inducted foreign terrorists in hundreds along the infiltration highways We then raised a counterinsurgency CI and counterterrorism CT force drawn from the Army itself and called it the Rashtriya Rifles RR one of our

They ended their stir after 42 days on September 21 following assurances from the State government to look into their demands. The Kolkata Police, which was investigating the crime initially, had arrested one civic volunteer before the CBI took over the investigation following an order of the Calcutta High Court. The CBI later arrested the former principal of the RG Kar Medical College Sandip Ghosh and now suspended officer-in-charge of Tala Police Station Abhijit Mondal in connection with their investigation of the rape-murder of the woman doctor. Junior medics on October 5 night started fast-unto-death following the West Bengal government missing their 24-hour-deadline to fulfil their demands in the wake of the rape-murder of a woman medic at the R.G. Kar Hospital. They withdrew their hunger strike on the 17th day after a meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday. The medics also called off their proposed shutdown in the State’s health sector scheduled to be initiated from Tuesday till an indefinite period.

RG Kar murder-rape case highlights: Junior doctors meet CM Mamata Banerjee; decide on setting up of task force by March 2025,"Updated - October 21, 2024 11:12 pm IST Dr Arnab Mukhopadhyay and other junior doctors after they called off their fast unto death over RG Kar Medical College rape and murder incident, in Kolkata, Monday, Oct 21, 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI Protesting junior doctors call off hunger strike after meeting Mamata but they also pledged to continue their struggle for justice and fight against threat culture. The talks between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and agitating junior doctors to resolve the impasse stemming from the rape and murder of a medic at RG Kar Medical Hospital was held for nearly two hours on Monday evening. Also Read: Kolkata rape and murder case: Medical registration of R.G. Kar ex-principal Sandip Ghosh cancelled “Dr Debasish Halder, a senior resident of anaesthesiology at Medical College, Kolkata, says that of the ten-point demands which were demanded to the government earlier, were a centralised referral system and live bed vacancy monitor. He highlights that a State task force was promised for the fulfilment of infrastructural demands. “You had earlier said that 5-7 junior doctors should be part of the State Task Force, but we had suggested more representatives be present from WBJDF on a rotational basis. However, if a SoP is formed for the State Task Force formation and a monthly meeting of the task force ensured, along with directives for the same, we believe our earlier agreements can be realised more constructively,” he says. “We want RDAs and MBBS student unions to be statutory bodies authorised by the government via a statute by West Bengal University of Health Sciences, and elected representatives from these bodies be elected into the aforementioned committees,” one of the protesting doctors suggest. The live is now closed Junior doctors stressed on establishing task force and grievance committees in every medical colleges with adequate representation from doctors in their meeting with Bengal CM today. Chief Secretariat Manoj Pant announced that student election will be held to select members for these committees by March, 2025. But the students also demanded of an interim committee till March, 2025 and they added that members in the interim committee also should be nominated by students and resident doctors. Junior doctors have announced to withdraw hunger strike after 17 days. They sat on a hunger strike at the Dorina crossing in Dharmatala in the heart of Kolkata on October 5, claiming that the government did not fulfil their demands. So far, six doctors on hunger strike have been hospitalised due to deteriorating health, while eight others were continuing the indefinite fast, demanding that the state government take constructive action by October 21 to resolve the deadlock. One of the junior doctors in today’s meeting with CM pointed towards the difficulties faced by women students while they want to lodge sexual harassment complaint. The junior doctor added that the kind of harassment women face from people, part of the threat culture, is unimaginable for lack of any proper grievance committee in medical colleges. State government has said they will send a written directives about the fulfilment of junior doctors’ demands and guidelines including a timeline on conducting student body elections in medical colleges by October 22, 3 p.m. A junior doctors in reply to CM said the suspension of 59 students were not unjust as they were notorious criminals. The doctor has said that there are cases of sexual harassment and extortion against those students. They pointed out how some students are given power and were entitled to continue threat culture. He even added that people in administrative role used their bureaucratic power to silence students. One of the junior doctors said they are yet to be informed about the structure and operations of the state task force. Doctors also complained that the state task force lacks representation from junior doctors. They demanded representation of 10 junior doctors in the task force on rotational basis. Mamata says, “You did your protests as per your capacity. You did well. It is your democratic right. I also did fasts and protests for 26 days. Not a single government officer came to meet me. I came to meet you. I ask for reports about your well-being every hour. I ask you, you tell me what you want not once, but ten times if you want. You have a future, you have a duty. I urge you to lift the protests and fast as soon as possible.”- Shrabana Chatterjee Mamata says, “Medical bodies and councils can only be changed through election process and there are rules set in place for it. They are autonomous bodies, we can not do that without the due process.” - Shrabana Chatterjee Mamata says, “I agree with you about recruitment. All vacancies need to be filled immediately. You have to understand that our hands our tied in many places, specially about reservations. We have tried regularly to get the matter up in the court, it is pending in the Supreme Court. You also have representation at the Supreme Court, I urge you to bring up this matter in court and ask them to speed up the process so we can fast track the recruitment.” - Shrabana Chatterjee Mamata says, “You need to be free of threat culture. Just because I am in power, I threaten someone, or someone threatens someone because they are in power. This cannot happen. No one can threat anyone.” - Shrabana Chatterjee Mamata says, “About exams. I will tell Chief Secretary that exams happen transparently, so no one can move their neck during exams. If I check old copies from last 3-4 years through a central agency then a lot of things will come up, no one wants that.” Doctors replied, “We want that to happen. There are many who have become house staff, many have gotten gold medals, they are not even qualified enough to pass exams.” - Shrabana Chatterjee Mamata says, “RG Kar Hospital principal is also here. You suspended 74 students without informing us. Is this okay? You should have let us know before taking the step. We do not want to ruin anyone’s future. We will form an enquiry committee and see if the accusations are proved. You know how much money we need to make a doctor. Making a MBBS doctor takes over 1 crore. State spends funds.”- Shrabana Chatterjee Dr Naiya says that separate people be appointed for central referral system and bed vacancy monitor system so the doctors who are engaged in treating patients are not burdened. “Doctors have to take a proactive role in this, the referrals happen through doctors,” the Chief Minister says. “I will ask the CS to put in place a mechanism, but I will also say that many principals and MSVPs do not fulfill their role properly and instead act politically,” she adds. - Moyurie Som The Chief Minister says that she saw on TV that the principal was gheraoed at a medical college in North Bengal. “A doctor was pressured to resign right then. Isn’t that threat culture? I agree with you that a safe and secure environment should exist,” she says.  She adds that in many cases, despite vacancies being advertised, not enough job applications are received.- Moyurie Som Chief Secretary Manoj Pant said already the state government has started central referral system as pilot projects in South 24 Parganas. He requested the doctors to send suggestion about operating this system smoothly across medical colleges in Bengal. Mr. Pant said he hopes to launch central referral system and bed monitoring system from November 1. “The Supreme Court is monitoring the work of the State government. We too want to ensure safe and secure work environment for healthcare workers,” Chief Secretary Manoj Pant says. Junior doctors have stated that majority of the resident and PGT doctors should have the right to elect the members of the committees that will be created for their safety and security. “We don’t want someone to be selected randomly like Sandip Ghose was made part various committees earlier,” says Debasih Haldar. “We have seen several documents that evidence corruption in medical institutions and were approved by the Principal Health Secretary. That has shaken our belief on the State healthcare system. We reiterate our demand for the removal of the Health Secretary,” one of the protesting doctors says, adding that they have brought the given documents for the CM to peruse. - Moyurie Som Dr Aniket Mahato, third year postgraduate trainee at RGKMCH, says that threat culture encompasses sexual molestation, financial extortion, harassment. “There is no place for a woman in our medical colleges to speak up about any harassment she might have faced,” he says. “Where is the safety of women in our medical college campuses? The formation of these committees is a small way to give women the minimum space to file a complaint.” Dr Akib Ashraf from Calcutta National Medical College urges immediate filling up of vacancy of doctors, nurses and group D staff across State-run hospitals. “If this manpower shortage sustains for a prolonged period of time, patients will be severely affected,” he said.
