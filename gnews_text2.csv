Explained | Marital rape: What are the legal issues in consideration before the Supreme Court? In the hearing on October 17, Senior advocate Karuna Nandy, appearing for AIDWA argued that a rapist remains a rapist, and marriage with his victim does not absolve him of the crime. Also Read | Unpacking the Centre’s affidavit on marital rape The discourse surrounding the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) involves several critical questions of law — does marriage endow husbands with the right to expect sexual relations, and does it entail implied consent for sex by the wife? Can this presumption of consent be rescinded in instances of sexual abuse within the marital bond?  The Marital Rape Exception (MRE), in Section 63, Exception 2 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (Section 375, Exception 2 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860) states that ‘Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.’ The provision is under challenge before the Supreme Court of India and the Centre has filed an affidavit in support of MRE which needs unpacking.  The court took seven years to hear petitions seeking to criminalise marital rape before coming up with a split verdict.

Warner willing to come out of retirement and play against India,"Published : Oct 22, 2024 18:52 IST , SYDNEY - 2 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE READ LATER David Warner of Australia during the 2024 T20 World Cup. | Photo Credit: Gareth Copley/Getty Images Former Australia opener David Warner on Tuesday said he is willing to come out of retirement and play against India in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy, if the home team needs him in the opening slot. The 37-year-old left-handed opener had announced his retirement from the sport earlier this year following the home Test against Pakistan. While the host had won the clash, Warner had scored 34 and 57 in both innings, respectively. “I’m always available, just got to pick up the phone. I’m always dead serious. Let’s be honest, the guys have played one red-ball game since their last Test matches in February, so I’ve almost had the same preparation,” Warned told Code Sports. READ: India A squad for Australia tour: Full list of players, venues and dates Australia’s home outing against India will be crucial for its quest to qualify for the final of the World Test Championship. The five-Test series gets underway in Perth on November 22. While the Australian players are preparing hard by participating in the Sheffield Shield, Warner will have to play some matches in the same to regain his fitness and impress the selectors again. “Honestly, if they really needed myself for this series, I’m more than happy to play the next Shield game and go out there and play. “I did retire for the right reasons to finish the game, and I wanted to finish (but) my hand is up if they desperately need someone. I’m not going to shy away from that,” he added.

Also, with Steven Smith having little success as an opener against the West Indies at home and in New Zealand, the Aussies have an opening headache. Having played four Tests since Warner’s retirement, Smith and Usman Khawaja have handled the opening duties. Evidently, Khawaja has collected the most runs (227) than Smith (171) in this phase, with both having a fifty each and no centuries. Their highest score is 75 and an unbeaten 91, respectively, both coming versus the Windies. The Kangaroos will be desperate to regain the trophy from Rohit Sharma and co, having lost it in the previous four instances.

"Sexual harassment rampant in Maharashtra medical colleges, finds survey","Updated - October 22, 2024 04:16 pm IST - CHENNAI Most of the complaints reported from different institutions involved the same type of harassment, implying that these issues were common to almost every institution, and were not limited to any one college. Photograph used for representational purposes only | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto A research paper on a survey of 308 students across 28 medical colleges in Maharashtra has revealed that gender discrimination and sexual harassment is rampant on these campuses. The paper, ‘Attitudes and perceptions of undergraduate medical students about sexual harassment and gender discrimination: A survey-based study’ by Harleen Kaur et al, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics last week. It revealed that 43.2% of the students surveyed had faced some form of gender discrimination/sexual harassment, when asked specifically -- a wide range of these instances were described by the students in the questionnaires they filled out for the survey. It also found there was a lack of awareness, leading to these incidents being considered “part and parcel” of the MBBS curriculum, highlighting the need for more awareness.

"Diabetes, obesity greatly increase risk of fatty liver","KOCHI: George (name changed), was 55-years-old when he was diagnosed with fatty liver. Since he was a teetotaller, he did not consider it to be a serious issue. However, during a subsequent health check-up, he was diagnosed with liver cancer. “He was suffering from other lifestyle diseases, including diabetes and cholesterol. The situation could have been avoided had he followed up regularly with a fibroscan and other liver-related tests. Such diseases, if identified early, are preventable and reversible,” said Dr John Menachery, senior consultant hepatologist at Rajagiri Hospital, Aluva. People who avoid alcohol tend to believe that they are safe from fatty liver disease. However, the number of people affected by fatty liver - alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) - has been on the rise in India. Unfortunately, most patients identify the condition at a later stage as it is mostly asymptomatic. Fatty liver disease, the leading cause of liver cirrhosis, is now referred to as metabolism associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) after a new nomenclature was adopted. This change reflects the growing understanding of the condition’s metabolic origins, says Dr Piyush Ranjan, vice-chairman of department of gastroenterology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi. “Earlier, fatty liver, which used to be diagnosed on ultrasound, was thought to be an innocuous condition and people did not bother about it. Follow-up studies have showed that fatty liver can progress to cirrhosis in some cases, and to hepatocellular carcinoma in some people,” said Dr V Mohan, chairman of Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai. According to a study published in 2022 in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology, ‘Prevalence of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in India: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis’, NAFLD prevalence in average-risk and high-risk subgroups was estimated to be 28.1% and 52.8%, respectively. The study concludes that about one in three adults or children have NAFLD in India. What is fatty liver? “The fat content in the liver should be less than 5%. Fatty liver is a condition when the fat content increases. The colour of the liver, which is chocolate or brown, turns yellow. When too much fat is deposited in the liver, it can lead to inflammation inside the liver and scarring and loss of liver function,” said Dr John. Dr Abraham Koshy, director of hepatology at VPS Lakeshore, Kochi, said fatty liver is prevalent in at least 20% – 30% of the Indian population. “There is an increase in the number of people affected by fatty liver in India. Earlier fatty liver was seen mostly in adults. However, with recent lifestyle changes, even children in the age group of 5 - 12 are also being diagnosed with the condition,” he said. “The overall prevalence of MASLD is around 30% of the population, while in people with diabetes it is 60%-70% of all people with type-2 diabetes. However, if diabetes and obesity are present, nearly 90% of them may have MASLD,” Dr Mohan added. Identifying the condition With screening, identification of risk factors and lifestyle modifications, the condition can be completely prevented. “The condition can be easily diagnosed with a liver function test. Usually, we identify the presence of fatty liver disease in a patient through an ultrasound scan. Some blood tests are carried out for further treatment and management of the condition,” said Dr Charles Panackel, senior consultant, hepatology and liver transplantation at Aster Medcity, Kochi. The condition usually has no symptoms. “Usually, what I have observed is that the condition is diagnosed when the person undergoes an ultrasound scan for the treatment of any other disease. Sometimes, an ultrasound scan may not give you a clear picture of the severity of fatty liver. The patients do not have to worry about the grading of fatty liver as well. The disease can be diagnosed with a liver function test,” said Dr John, adding that further tests, including fibroscan, platelet count and endoscopy, will provide a clear picture of the condition. Management The condition, if untreated and not properly managed, can lead to other complications, including liver damage, heart problems, cirrhosis, and in later stages liver cancer. “In the initial stage, people may take it lightly as it is less harmful. However, the condition can lead to liver cirrhosis, inflammation, bleeding, giddiness, jaundice, and even liver damage and liver cancer,” said Dr Charles. “The disease becomes dangerous when liver functions are affected. If there is no inflammation in the liver, then it is a relatively harmless condition. If there is inflammation, it can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis,” said Dr John, emphasising that lifestyle modifications are recommended to address and solve the issue. “Recognising the risk factors and controlling diabetes levels and cholesterol through proper diet and exercise can help. Also, fibrosis and inflammation can cause liver damage,” he said. Currently, the primary treatment approach focuses on addressing underlying risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. “Lifestyle changes, including dietary management and regular exercise, form the foundation of treatment,” said Dr Ranjan. “The condition can be reversed by following a proper diet, exercise and even walking for 30 to 45 minutes every day. It is unfortunate that, in my experience, only around 10% of the patients follow these directions to manage the condition,” said Dr Abraham. “Carbohydrates like white rice or refined wheat should be replaced with good quality protein preferably from vegetable sources (plant sources) and good quality fats (monounsaturated fats like nuts, seeds, and healthy oils),” said Dr Mohan. The disease is still in an area of active research and a number of newer drugs are expected to be available in near future. “Drugs like Resmetirom, which acts on thyroid hormone receptors, have now have recently been approved by the FDA in the US for treatment of MASLD. These are specific treatments, but they are very expensive and do have side effects. Many other drugs are also in the pipeline for treating MASLD. GLP-1 receptor analogues like semaglutide, liraglutide and dulaglutide have shown to reduce fatty liver by managing weight loss and obesity. SGLT2 drugs like dapagliflozin have also shown to be beneficial for those with fatty liver,” added Dr Mohan. “Vitamin E and Pioglitazone are the drugs which showed improvement in fatty liver in initial studies. Saroglitazaar is a PPAR agonist drug used to treat hyper triglyceridemia has been approved by DGCI in fatty liver,” Dr Ranjan said. Alcoholic fatty liver Alcoholic fatty liver is a condition caused when fat accumulates due to consumption of alcohol. Continuous drinking can result in cirrhosis. According to the World Health Organisation’s latest guidelines, no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health. “Simple fatty liver due to alcohol can be reversed with abstinence from alcohol for more than three months. However, once it has reached the stage of cirrhosis, then reversal may not occur even after keeping away from alcohol,” said Dr John. According to a study published in 2020, ‘Epidemiology of non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver diseases’, in India, alcohol is the most common cause of cirrhosis (34.3%) and almost 20% of all liver disease patients (irrespective of aetiology) are current alcohol consumers. Risks People with risk factors need to be more cautious. “As diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, etc. are risk elements, lifestyle modifications, exercise, and diet can prevent the occurrence of the condition,” said Dr Abraham. Dr Charles pointed out that the risk of getting affected by fatty liver is high if the person has a family history. A significant number of patients who undergo liver transplant surgeries are also fatty liver patients, said Dr Abraham. “In my experience, around 30% of people who undergo liver transplantation are fatty liver cases. Earlier, most of the transplant cases I dealt with were caused by alcoholism and virus infection. It is because the condition, in many patients, is asymptomatic even in the later stage,” he said.

"US GP Talking Points: Verstappen's Form, Wolff Piles in on Stewards And Lawson Strong Contender to Replace","Published By: Feroz Khan AFP Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 11:02 IST Austin, Texas, USA (From left) Toto Wolff, Max Verstappen and Liam Lawson. (AP Photo) Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc claimed victory at the Circuit of the Americas, while Max Verstappen and Red Bull demonstrated they have recovered some form after a mid-season dip but still have much to do to retain their titles. Also Read: Valencia CF Fans Protest Against Singapore Owner The three-time champion’s battling third-place finish behind Leclerc and Carlos Sainz may have extended his lead in the title race to 57 points -– but amid continuing rumours about “tricky” car components and a resurgent ‘prancing horse’ both championship battles remain wide open. A look at three things we learned from Sunday’s dramatic action at the Circuit of the Americas: Verstappen regains some form Series leader Verstappen’s relative return to form — by winning Saturday’s sprint race and finishing on the podium in Sunday’s Grand Prix — showed he and Red Bull have shaken off their mid-season blues. But they need to rediscover their winning habit of old to prove they can resist their rivals, led by Lando Norris and McLaren, to retain one or both of their championship titles. After nine Grands Prix without a win dating back to the Spanish Grand Prix in June, Verstappen showed he retains his competitive instincts –- some might add that at times he stretched the rules with his defensive work and needed a compliant stewards’ decision to succeed –- by finishing third. But to prove he retains the ascendancy, victories are needed as Red Bull fend off continuing talk of trickery as relations with McLaren threaten to turn sour, team boss Zak Brown continuing to air suspicions of possible alleged cheating. Brown told reporters on Sunday he would accept Red Bull’s claim that they have not used a hybrid ride-height control device fitted into the footwell of their cars only if senior staff signed a sworn statement. “I’d like to see the senior leadership, the former chief mechanics and the current mechanics sign an affidavit stating that they have never used or have no knowledge of it being used,” he told the Daily Mail. Brown was reacting to the FIA’s statement their investigation into possible cheating was closed as they believed there was no way of discovering if the controversial device had ever been used. His standpoint may only be part of the technical, political and sporting battle between the teams as they enter the championship run-in, but added to claims of inconsistent decisions by the stewards –- who favoured Verstappen on Sunday by penalising Norris five seconds for running off track when forced to do so -– it cranks up the pressure. Wolff piles in on stewards and Red Bull Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff joined Brown in piling in on the stewards’ decisions and described the FIA’s role in the Red Bull “trickery” row as “outrageous” -– throwing a smoke screen over his team’s upgrades’ flop in Austin. Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton blamed the extensive package of new parts for his car’s capricious behaviour, resulting in an early exit, while George Russell started from the pit-lane before finishing sixth. Both grumbled about their cars’ handling -– and Wolff admitted to “issues” before joining the Red Bull debate and asking why the Milton Keynes-based outfit needed their rogue ride height device on the car. “My view from the distance of what I’ve seen and heard is that it’s outrageous,” he said. “I wonder how long it took them to make this and to stick it in there? And I didn’t know that in F1 we were using such devices. “It’s not good enough to say ‘you know, that’s it. Promise I’m not going to do it again…’ Why would you design such a thing, and put two marks on it for two positions? Is that the precise decision making in F1?” The FIA’s Nikolas Tombazis made clear the matter was closed and Red Bull would not be sanctioned, but as tensions rise it remains likely the verbal war will continue in Mexico next weekend. Lawson emerges as contender to replace Perez New Zealander Liam Lawson emerged from his comeback race as Red Bull’s replacement for Daniel Ricciardo as a genuine contender to succeed the struggling Sergio Perez at Red Bull. Starting 19th, after inheriting an engine change penalty, 22-year-old Lawson came home ninth, just 10 seconds adrift of Perez who finished seventh. “A really great debut,” said Red Bull’s influential 81-year-old consultant Helmut Marko. “Great passing moves and control at all times.”"

(Picture Credit: PTI) Sanju Samson was on fire for Team India in the third T20I against Bangladesh, which was played at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on October 12. The 29-year-old wicketkeeper-batter opened for the Suryakumar Yadav-led side and hammered 111 runs from 47 balls. He completed his maiden T20I century in just 40 balls and, in process, also became the second fastest Indian batter to a century in the shortest format of the game. His super show with the bat in the last match of the bilateral series silenced his critics, who time and again have questioned his potential to perform at the highest level. Samson, who has scored a century in his last T20I and ODI match for India, in a recent interview has now opened up about his dream to play Test cricket for India. According to the right-handed batter, who was part of India’s 2024 T20 World Cup squad, he enjoys playing the red-ball format of the game since childhood, and it’s his dream to play Test cricket for the Indian team. “Mere ko sabse maja toh Test cricket mein he aata hai. Test cricket ka maja toh apko kahi aur nahi mil skta. Vo pura apko nichod leta hai. Test cricket mein bande ka quality dikhta he hai. 5 din ka mehnat jo hai, mental toughness, physical toughness hai aur usme maja bahut hai. Mujhe jab bhi mauka milta hai, main aake Kerala ke liye Ranji Trophy khelta hoon kyuki vo Ranji mei 4 din tumhara pura nichod leti hai cricket. Toh usme bahut mehnat lagta hai. Usme jab success milta hai itna mehnat kar ke toh uska maja kuch aur he hai (I enjoy playing Test cricket the most. You can’t have the feel of playing Test cricket anywhere else. It completely squeezes you. The real quality of a cricketer is visible in Test cricket. There is hard work of 5 days, mental toughness, physical toughness, and there is a lot of fun in it. Whenever I get a chance, I come and play Ranji Trophy for Kerala because it squeezes you completely for 4 days in Ranji cricket. So it takes a lot of hard work. When you get success in it after working so hard, it gives great pleasure),"" Sanju said on Vimal Kumar’s YouTube channel. (From 13:52)  “Mujhe Test cricket khelne ka bachpan se bahut hai. Mai bolta nahi hoon itna, Mann ke andar he rakhta hoon, but I have always wanted to play Test cricket for my country. So abhi dekhte hai aage (I have been wanting to play Test cricket since childhood. I don’t say this much; I keep it in my mind, but I have always wanted to play Test cricket for my country. So let’s see what’s ahead)"" he added. Samson, who has 3834 runs to his name in 65 First Class matches played so far, was last seen in action for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 match against Karnataka, which was played in Alur. He remained unbeaten on 15 runs in that match."

(Image: PTI) CRPF schools across India have received another threat on email. Though the email is suspected to be a hoax, but the fresh threat has triggered panic in all schools including Delhi. The email is suspected to be an act by someone to create panic. The sender has subjected the mail as “Nitrate based Improvised EDs in listed school rooms.” The sender has also asked to evacuate all schools before 11 am. The CRPF school in Delhi’s Rohini as already witnessed a blast, which remains a mystery as the accused are at large. According to the sources, in the fresh mail sent late on Monday night, the accused has said, “Due to the impact created by the recent arrest of Mr Jaffer Sadiq of DMK in the meth case, international pressure has mounted. Thus, leading to the Tamil Nadu Police intelligence getting highly polarised with the internal DMK family matters. Hence such blasts in/near Central(Union) Government schools are necessary to divert the attention away from the MK Stalin family’s involvement in the case.” “Benami of MK Stalin, Mr Arjundurai Rajasankar and his wife Mrs Narmada Rathnakumar Nadar have been made pawns with ED coming for their nearest and dearest. Hence, such whistle-blowing is necessary. Act soon,” the sender, who identified himself as Kiruthiga Devdiya, said. He further said that Manickavasagam Ramalingam, who worked with CCTNS account during his capacity as VP NIIT Tech, is a missing link in the Remote Control Systems (RCS) Galileo app used by IPS Jaffer Sait and K Radhakrishnan as it contained sensitive intel of Mrs Kiruthiga Udhayanidhi and Mrs Narmada Rathnakumar getting intimate with Kiruthiga’s son Inban Udhayanidhi. “At any cost the Political Intel of Tamil Nadu will want it from not falling into the wrong group.

The Delhi Police on Monday said they are probing a possible Khalistani link to a blast at the CRPF school in Rohini’s Prashant Vihar area. It has written to Telegram, a messaging app, seeking information about a group claiming responsibility for the explosion in a purported social media post on the platform. The purported message, posted on Sunday evening (October 20), said the blast was in retaliation to the alleged targeting of pro-Khalistan separatists by Indian agents. The claim was made by Justice League India using a clip of the blast with a “Khalistan Zindabad” watermark at the bottom, and circulated on social media platforms. The strong explosion on Sunday morning ripped through a wall but no one was hurt in the incident, which is also being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). This comes against the backdrop of a series of bomb threats sent to several airlines in the last few days."

Karnataka HC: No Bail For Prajwal Revanna; PIL Against Rahul Gandhi Over His Comments Against The Leader Di,"Reported By: Rohini Swamy Last Updated: OCTOBER 21, 2024, 16:17 IST Bengaluru, India The 33-year-old Prajwal was arrested on May 31. The Karnataka High Court (HC) on Friday rejected the bail and anticipatory bail applications filed by suspended Janata Dal (S) leader Prajwal Revanna, who is accused of rape and sexual assault. The HC also dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking legal action against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his alleged comments against former Hassan MP Prajwal during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Karnataka earlier this year. The All India Dalit Action Committee had filed the PIL, requesting the court to direct Gandhi to issue an unconditional apology to women for his statements, and disrespecting the Constitution. The petition claimed that Gandhi made the remarks on May 2 during election rallies in Shivamogga and Raichur, just prior to the polls on May 7, 2024. The bench stated that the court must uphold a standard when determining whether a matter qualifies as a public interest issue, noting that not every grievance can be raised in court via a PIL. They acknowledged that Gandhi’s remarks, while potentially controversial, do not meet the criteria for a PIL. In dismissing the case, the court reiterated the importance of careful consideration regarding what constitutes a public interest issue, affirming its discretion in handling such petitions. Additionally, a fine of Rs 25,000 was imposed on the petitioner while dismissing the case. The counsel representing the All India Dalit Action Committee argued that Gandhi’s statements outraged the modesty of women and constituted fabricated accusations against Revanna. They contended that such speeches were damaging in a small town like Hassan, creating mistrust among households. They sought the court to impose a token fine on Gandhi for the supposed misuse of his public position, breach of public trust, and violations of various legal provisions, including the Model Code of Conduct for the 2024 Parliamentary elections and the Representation of the People Act, 1951. During the hearing, the bench, consisting of Chief Justice N V Anjaria and Justice K V Aravind, indicated that the case did not qualify as a public interest litigation. The court stated, “We have not said anything on the merits; we are not saying anything on the merits of the speech. We have only said this cannot be the subject matter under public interest litigation,” according to Live Law.

Rabada became the fastest to 300 Test wickets, achieving the feat in 11,187 balls with a strike rate of 39.39, to break former Pakistan pacer Waqar Younis’ record of 12,602 balls. South Africa was 140-6 in reply when bad light stopped play, with a 34-run lead after a day of attrition for batsmen as a total of 16 wickets fell. Kyle Verreynne (18 not out) and Wiaan Mulder (17 not out) will resume on Tuesday. All-rounder Mulder took the first three wickets early in the opening session to leave Bangladesh, who had won the toss and elected to bat, reeling at 21-3 before Rabada bowled Mushfiqur Rahim to reach the milestone. His 300th wicket came in his 65th Test. Only five other South African bowlers have taken 300 or more Test wickets, with Dale Steyn’s 439 topping the list.

South Africa took 14 overs after lunch to skittle out Bangladesh, whose opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy top-scored with 30 before being the seventh wicket to fall. It was the second-lowest total at the venue, after the 87 that Bangladesh scored when it lost by an innings and eight runs to Pakistan in December 2021. Rabada finished with figures of 3-26, Mulder 3-22 and spinner Keshav Maharaj 3-34 with Dane Piedt taking the other wicket when he bowled Mahmudul at the start of the second session. Taijul Islam took 5-49 in South Africa’s reply, passing the 200-Test wicket mark as the visitor struggled to settle under the home spin attack. Tony de Zorzi (30), Ryan Rickelton (27) and Stubbs (23) all threatened to get going but Taijul had them all caught behind off his turning deliveries. South Africa’s reply started poorly with stand-in captain Aiden Markram playing on to Hasan Mahmud and being dismissed for six at the end of the first over.

"P Diddy Lands in More Trouble: Sean Combs Faces 7 New Lawsuits, Accused of Raping Teenage Girl","Published By: Dishya Sharma Associated Press Last Updated: OCTOBER 22, 2024, 14:35 IST Mumbai, India Diddy is facing multiple sexual crime charges. (Reuters) Seven new lawsuits have been filed against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, including one alleging the rape of a 13-year-old girl. They come as his lawyers tried again Monday to get him freed on bail, and complained that a “fresh wave of publicity” is endangering his right to a fair criminal trial. In the lawsuits filed Sunday in state and federal courts, four men and three women, all anonymous, allege they were sexually assaulted by Combs at parties over the last two decades. Combs, 54, has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking charges contained in an indictment unsealed the day after his Sept. 16 arrest. Charges include allegations he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees, and silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson, and physical beatings. He has remained incarcerated pending a May 5 trial after two judges denied bail in rulings being appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Combs’ lawyers asked a judge Sunday to order potential witnesses and their lawyers to stop making statements that could prevent a fair trial. “As the Court is aware, Mr. Combs has been the target of an unending stream of allegations by prospective witnesses and their counsel in the press,” they wrote. “These prospective witnesses and their lawyers have made numerous inflammatory extrajudicial statements aimed at assassinating Mr. Combs’s character in the press.” The latest lawsuits are drawn from what lawyers say are more than 100 accusers who are planning legal action against Combs. Plaintiffs’ lawyer Tony Buzbee announced the planned litigation at an Oct. 1 news conference and posted a 1-800 number for accusers to call. As before, Combs’ representatives dismissed the latest lawsuits as “clear attempts to garner publicity.” They said Combs and his legal team “have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process.” Combs “has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman,” they added. One of the lawsuits filed Sunday alleges that a 13-year-old girl who was invited to a party by a limousine driver after the Video Music Awards in Manhattan in September 2000 was raped by a “male celebrity” and then by Combs as individuals identified only as “Celebrity A,” a male, and “Celebrity B,” a female, watched. Another lawsuit alleged that Combs sexually assaulted a 17-year-old male at a Manhattan hotel penthouse party in 2022. In the lawsuits, it was alleged that the plaintiffs believed they had been fed drinks laced with drugs before they were assaulted. Meanwhile, lawyers for Combs on Monday told the 2nd Circuit in a filing that he’ll renew his bail application before the lower court based on “significant changed circumstances.” They said the issues include “constitutional concerns stemming from his conditions of confinement and evidence contained in recently produced discovery.” In a filing last week, prosecutors told the appeals court that judges denied bail after evidence showed Combs “used methodical and sophisticated means to silence and intimidate witnesses throughout the racketeering conspiracy and during the Government’s investigation.”"
Champions League 2024-25: Emery wants to ‘break barriers’ at transformed Aston Villa,"Published : Oct 21, 2024 22:57 IST , BIRMINGHAM - 3 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE READ LATER Aston Villa manager Unai Emery attends a press conference at Bodymoor Heath Training Centre, Birmingham, England, Monday Oct. 21, 2024. | Photo Credit: AP Unai Emery is determined to ensure Aston Villa’s Champions League success is not a flash in the pan as the Spaniard aims to “break barriers” at a club he has transformed. Villa are off to their best start in the Premier League since 1998, with 17 points from their opening eight games and have won their first two fixtures in the Champions League, including a famous victory over Bayern Munich. Emery is a specialist in European competition, having won the Europa League four times and led Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals two years ago. Prior to this season, Villa’s last experience at the highest level of European football was back in 1983, while it has not won a trophy since 1996. But Emery wants to maintain the standards he has set since taking charge two years ago. “I don’t want to waste my time here, that is my message,” he said ahead of Bologna’s visit to Villa Park in the Champions League on Tuesday. ALSP READ | Juventus determined to excel in Europe and Italy, says coach Thiago Motta “My objective here is to keep the same level we have now, Champions League and add more to be contenders for titles. “We want to achieve the objectives and one of them is to play in the Champions League. It is not about playing there only because of some circumstances -- I want to us to stay there for a long time. “It is difficult. Maybe sometimes you can have some problems or struggle in our way, but you have to be resilient. We want to be strong in the idea in our mind and create a strong mentality to always break barriers.” Victory over the Italians would likely give Villa enough points to progress to at least the play-off round of the Champions League with five games to spare. Emery’s men are also above the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United in the Premier League table, all of whom they beat to a top-four finish last season. “We are fourth in the Premier League, we are with two wins in the Champions League,” added Emery. “Tomorrow hopefully we will play showing we believe we can compete. I don’t know how far we are going to get but in this moment we are here, in a good position in the Premier League and Champions League.” Defender Matty Cash is set for his Champions League bow after missing the wins over Young Boys and Bayern due to injury. “In the last four years since I joined, the club has just gone through the roof, the quality in every single department has gone up and the club has not got a ceiling,” said Cash. “I think it can go all the way to the top. You can see now playing Champions League football has been a building block to get here and the manager has been a big part of that to get us here.” COMMENTS Aston Villa / Champions League / Premier League / Villarreal / Bayern Munich / Bologna / Tottenham BACK TO TOP"

With this win, India is on top of the points table with 9 points while New Zealand is placed second with 5 points and Australia are placed third with four points.

It was, in fact, hosts Malaysia who made a roaring start to the match by putting India on the backfoot early in the game. A quick-fire goal was set up by their captain Muhammad Addy Jazmi Jamlus who assisted Muhammad Danish Aiman to score a fine field goal in the 8th minute of the match. They doubled this lead in the following minute when Osman Harris scored from a PC. Though the 2-0 lead for Malaysia was a setback for India, their forwards shook off the early nerves and created scoring opportunities.

India equalised in the 13th minute when Arshdeep Singh assisted by Manmeet Singh scored a fine field goal.

Later, Rohit extended the lead to 4-2 with a fine PC attack. The fourth quarter began with Malaysia earning a PC, but they were off the mark. In the following minutes, there was a flurry of PC’s won by both India and Malaysia but neither could come up with a successful conversion. However, India did well to hold on to the 4-2 lead till the final hooter and stay on top of the points table."

"India hit hard as 2026 Commonwealth Games drops hockey, wrestling, badminton, cricket, table tennis","Advertisement LONDON: In a body blow to India's medal prospects in the Commonwealth Games, key sports such as hockey, badminton, wrestling, cricket and shooting have been dropped from the 2026 edition by host city Glasgow, which unveiled a pruned roster of 10 disciplines to keep the event budget-friendly and free of ""operational risks"". Table tennis, squash and triathlon have also been axed in a bid to limit the cost and streamline logistics given that only four venues will host the entire showpiece. The total number of events at the Games will be nine fewer compared to the 2022 Birmingham edition. ""The Games will include 10 sports striking a balance between ensuring the event has a multi-sport feel and the need to manage financial and operational risk,"" the Commonwealth Games Federation said in a statement. ""The sports programme will include Athletics and Para Athletics (Track & Field), Swimming and Para Swimming, Artistic Gymnastics, Track Cycling and Para Track Cycling, Netball, Weightlifting and Para Powerlifting, Boxing, Judo, Bowls and Para Bowls, and 3x3 Basketball and 3x3 Wheelchair Basketball,"" the Commonwealth Games Federation said in a statement. The 23rd edition of the Games is scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 2, marking Glasgow's return as host after 12 years. ""The Games will take place across four venues -- Scotstoun Stadium, Tollcross International Swimming Centre, Emirates Arena -- including the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, and the Scottish Event Campus (SEC). Athletes and support staff will be housed in hotel accommodation,"" it added. The roster is a massive setback to India's medal prospects given that the bulk of the country's medals came from the removed disciplines in the past editions. Shooting was never expected to return after being dropped from the Birmingham programme four years ago, owing to logistics. While announcing the Glasgow schedule, the CGF said ""Glasgow 2026 will feature a 10-sport programme concentrated across four venues within an eight-mile corridor"". This ruled shooting out of the roster as the Barry Buddon centre in Dundee -- the venue during the 2014 CWG -- is more than 100km away from Glasgow. Also, archery continued to be ignored. The sport last featured at the Games in the 2010 Delhi edition. Glasgow Green, which hosted hockey in 2014, has been dropped from the list of venues, while the Emirates Arena, where badminton was held that year, will be used only for cycling this time at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome there. ""Cost and operational risk were the main drivers. Every venue introduced brings added costs and complexity for venue hire, security, transport etc. To minimise those risks, it was determined that it would be too costly to add additional venues,"" the organisers stated justifying limiting the Games to just four venues. Aside from cost, hockey's exclusion could also be down to the fact that the Games are being organised close to the World Cup that is scheduled two weeks later from August 15 to 30 in Wavre, Belgium and Amstelveen, Netherlands The Australian state of Victoria was the original host of the 2026 edition but pulled out last year due to rising costs. Scotland then stepped in to save the Games. Hockey's omission from the Games would be a significant blow for India. The men's team has won three silver and two bronze medals, while the women have also shone, clinching three medals, including a historic gold in the 2002 Games. In badminton, India has racked up an impressive 31 medals -- 10 gold, eight silver, and 13 bronze. Notably, the nation was to enter the 2026 edition as defending champions in men's and women's singles, as well as men's doubles. Shooting was a stronghold for India, with a staggering 135 medals to its name. The count included 63 gold, 44 silver, and 28 bronze. The wrestling competition has yielded 114 medals for the nation, including 49 gold, 39 silver, and 26 bronzes. After the cricket's reintroduction in 2022, the Indian women's team claimed a silver. Para-athletes have been a part of the Games since the 2002 Manchester edition and will continue to be there in the 2026 edition as well. ""Para sport will once again be fully integrated as a key priority and point of difference for the Games, with six Para sports included on the sport programme,"" CGF said. The CGF said that the Games will deliver over 100 million pounds of ""inward investment into the city"" and is expected to add an economic value of over 150 million pounds for the region. The body asserted that all this would be possible thanks to a model ""that has been specially designed to not require public funding for the delivery of the Games.""
