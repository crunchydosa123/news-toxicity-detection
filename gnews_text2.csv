"Maharashtra’s battle is between two crorepatis and the poor, says Rahul Gandhi","Updated - November 18, 2024 09:47 pm IST - Mumbai Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi speaks during the press conference for Maharashtra Elections in Mumbai. | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “ek hain toh safe hain” (united we are safe) slogan, with posters featuring the map of Dharavi and of Mr. Modi with industrialist Gautam Adani. He was speaking during his only press conference of the campaign for the Maharashtra Assembly election, held in Mumbai ahead of polling on Wednesday (November 18, 2024). “This is a battle of ideologies. Maharashtra’s battle is between two ‘crorepatis’ and the poor. A crorepati wants ₹1 lakh crore while we think the youth and poor of Maharashtra need help. Inflation, price rise, poverty, unemployment are the issues,” he said during his press conference at a hotel in the business district of central Mumbai.

This is the biggest issue in the country today. Backward Classes, Dalits and Adivasis are 50% of the population. Yet, they don’t have any say in the system. We want to change that. So we don’t want even the 50% cap on reservation. Health insurance, unemployment allowance, and 2.5 lakh government jobs opened up for people – these are the things we promise. The target is Adani. The target is to change Mumbai,” he said. As he spoke, he pulled out the two posters from a safe, which was brought there by a few workers. “Mr. Modi gave the slogan ‘ek hein toh safe hein’. This is his safe. But this is what he means,” he said, holding up the two posters, one showing the map of Dharavi and another showing the industrialist with Mr. Modi, with the ‘ek hai toh Safe hai’ slogan underneath. This is his safe, said Rahul Gandhi, as he unveiled a map of Dharavi, a photo of Gautam Adani and Narendra Modi. “This is what Modi means when he says, ek hein toh safe hein.” | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini He thereafter read a list of eight projects, alleging that these businesses were driven away from Maharashtra to the neighbouring State of Gujarat, robbing the poll-bound State of ₹7 lakh crore worth of investment and 5 lakh jobs for its youth. “Vedanta and Foxconn could have generated employment for your youth. It has been taken away from you, so was the Tata-Airbus project that would have given employment to thousands of youth. A bulk drug park worth ₹3,000 crore was sent away,” he said, claiming that the BJP’s narrative of “batoge toh katoge” (divided we fall) was a diversionary tactic to distract people from the main issues.

I agree with what [Shiv Sena (UBT) chief] Uddhav Thackeray has said. Batting for the scrapping of Dharavi redevelopment project under the Adani Group, he said, “Our objection is that it is unfair. The entire political machinery is being twisted to help one person. We are not convinced about how the tendering process was worked out and we are absolutely convinced that this is theft of Dharavi land and it is being handed over to one person.” “Without the clear support of the Prime Minister, Dharavi cannot be taken away from the people of India. This is what has happened. This is the election issue on the foreground and background,” he said, alleging that airports, defence manufacturing industries, ports, and Dharavi “were being given to Adani”. The BJP hit back at Mr. Gandhi calling him “fake”, and claiming that the industrialist benefitted the most during the Congress regime. Showing a photograph of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra with Mr. Adani, BJP General Secretary Vinod Tawde, at a press conference, claimed that the Congress government in Telangana had signed an MoU with Adani Group worth ₹12,400 crore, while the erstwhile Rajasthan government had allegedly signed a deal worth ₹46,000 crore with the industrialist.

"If Modi, Shah, Ambani are 'ek', then they are 'safe': Rahul mocks BJP's slogan","Advertisement RANCHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday mocked BJP's 'ek rahenge toh safe rahenge' (if we remain united, we will be safe) slogan, by claiming that it translated into the ""unity"" between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and billionaires like Ambani. The Congress leader also attacked Modi for not visiting Manipur which has been ""burning"" for the last one-and-a-half years, and alleged that Shah was not taking interest in containing violence in the northeastern state as ""vested interests"" were at play. ""I will explain the real meaning of BJP's slogan 'ek hai to safe hai'. It is if Modi, Shah and Ambani are 'ek' (united), then they are 'safe',"" Gandhi claimed at a press conference in Ranchi on the last day of campaigning. The former Congress president alleged that the country's prime assets such as airports, ports and natural resources were being handed over to billionaires like Adani and Ambani without following transparent tender processes. Gandhi asserted that caste census was a must for the country and it would provide wealth distribution data, helping the Congress to take accurate decisions. ""I consider it a mistake that the UPA government, which came up with the idea of a caste census, did not implement it,"" the Rae Bareli MP asserted. A caste census will reveal the place of SCs, STs, and OBCs, who are 73 per cent of India's population, in the country's power structure, he said, adding that the survey will also lead to the country's development and transformation. ""This is a battle of ideologies. On one hand is the INDIA bloc which is protecting the Constitution and wants to run a government of poor, Dalits and Adivasis. On the other hand are those powers that want to destroy the Constitution. This is what senior leaders of the BJP and RSS have said,"" he alleged. ""I had said in the Lok Sabha that the Congress and INDIA bloc will conduct caste census to know the percentage of Dalits, Adivasis and backward communities, and their participation in different institutions. I also said that the 50 per cent cap on reservations will be removed by the Congress and INDIA bloc,"" Gandhi said. He alleged that the Prime Minister is lying when he says that Rahul Gandhi is against reservations. ""I am not against reservations, I want to increase it beyond 50 per cent. I requested PM Modi to hold caste census and increase reservations but he did not respond,"" he said. He added that the BJP is against ""our plans"" of increasing reservations and conducting caste census. ""(If voted to power) Congress will get caste census done to find out representation of OBCs, SCs, tribals in institutions, private firms, judiciary and other institutions,"" he said. On Manipur, he said that the entire country is watching what is happening in the northeastern state. ""Manipur has been burning for the last one-and-a-half years but PM Modi did not visit the state even once. I went there, saw the situation and urged the government to control the violence. The (Union) Home Minister should have done his work but he is not taking interest. Some vested interest is at play,"" he alleged. The Congress leader, however, did not provide any evidence to back his allegations. About Jharkhand, he said, ""We will conduct caste census here and increase the reservation. ST reservations will be increased from 26 per cent to 28 per cent, SC reservations from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, and OBC from 14 per cent to 27 per cent. We are trying to implement this, but BJP people are trying to stop us,"" he said. Terming the BJP as ""anti-tribal"", Gandhi said it arrested Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren and tried to intimidate him with false cases. The Enforcement Directorate had arrested Soren on January 31 in a money laundering case linked to a land scam. He was released from jail on June 28 after the high court granted him bail. Accusing the BJP-led Centre of working against the interests of the state, Gandhi claimed that it is not releasing Rs 1. 36 lakh crore coal dues of Jharkhand besides other funds besides land compensation and other dues creating obstacles to development. ""We want to run government for the poor, not for billionaires but BJP is handing over mines, forests, land in Jharkhand to capitalists,"" he alleged. The Congress leader accused PM Modi of handing over the country's wealth to a few billionaires and charged him with trying to transfer Rs 1 lakh crore worth of Dharavi land in Maharashtra to Adani. He also alleged that political decisions in the country were being influenced by billionaires. ""In the political meeting to topple the Maharashtra government, Adani was present besides Home Minister Shah,"" Gandhi claimed. He promised that if voted to power, the INDIA bloc would give 10 lakh jobs to the youths of Jharkhand, Rs 2,500 financial assistance to women, make gas cylinders available at Rs 450 and distribute 7 kg of free ration under food security and health insurance cover of upto Rs 15 lakh. In the second phase of Jharkhand assembly elections, polling for 38 seats will be held on November 20. Votes will be counted on November 23.

"‘Northeast Will Become War Zone If…’ Intel Sources Flag Manipur Toolkit, Link Latest Violence To Drug Trade","The Manipur destabilisation toolkit is “clearly visible"", top intelligence sources told CNN-News18, noting that the modus operandi was to attack infrastructure development and society, create a leadership crisis, and send more sophisticated weapons. “There is a complete law and order breakdown with new tactics which are beyond assessment for law and order agencies. This is an intelligence failure at the local level,"" they said amid the fresh wave of violence in Manipur following the deaths of 11 suspected militants in exchange of fire with security forces. The violence escalated the following day, with six civilians, including women and children, being abducted by armed militants from the same area. “Attackers on Meitei civilians travelled 200 kilometres from Churachandpur to Jiribam and their movement was unnoticed. Earlier, it was believed that Kukis will abduct and release the civilians but this killing tells a different story. The abductions, rapes and killings are a war game at a different level"". They added: “The abduction, killing and rape toolkit is designed in such a way that it’s finally taking to complete social unrest. Meiteis have no faith in the social machinery, including politicians from their community. Out of fear, local politicians are not seen with the community, resulting in arson and attacks on them."" The sources said the timing of the recent violence was also important. “The attacks began soon after Mizoram Chief Minister Lalduhoma’s comments in the United States about the need for a ‘Christian nation’ of the Kuki-Zo people under a unified leadership. His statement proposed consolidating Kuki-Zo populations across India, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The statement outside India ignited these groups from across the border and they decided to launch the final assault for a decisive move."" CNN-News18 had reported earlier how different groups want to carve out a Christian state with the help of drug money. The security agencies also warned about the escalation of the Kuki-Meitei war, saying there was an urgent need to contain it or “Northeast will become a war zone"".     LATEST BLOGS"

The schedule has been rescheduled, but we haven’t received any cancellation notice. Every other team in the world, that has qualified for the Champions Trophy, is ready to come and has no issues,"" he claimed. The PCB Chairman also emphasised the need to keep sports and politics apart and the two should not interfere with each other as well. “I still believe that sports and politics should not interfere with each other, and I maintain a positive outlook,"" he commented. The Champions Trophy returns after eight years with Pakistan as the defending champions. They beat India by 180 runs in 2017 to claim the title under Sarfaraz Ahmed’s captaincy.   LATEST BLOGS"
The ’super year’ of elections has been super bad for incumbents as voters punish them in droves,"Published - November 18, 2024 12:58 pm IST - BANGKOK President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday (November 13, 2024) in Washington. File | Photo Credit: AP Whether on the left or the right, regardless of how long they’ve been in power, sitting governments around the world have been drubbed this year by disgruntled voters in what has been called the “super year” for elections. Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was just the latest in a long line of losses for incumbent parties in 2024, with people in some 70 countries accounting for about half the world’s population going to the polls. Issues driving voter discontent have varied widely, though there has been almost universal malaise since the COVID-19 pandemic as people and businesses struggle to get back on their feet while facing stubbornly high prices, cash-strapped governments and a surge in migration. “There’s an overall sense of frustration with political elites, viewing them as out of touch, that cuts across ideological lines,” said Richard Wike, director of global attitudes research at the Pew Research Center. He noted that a Pew poll of 24 countries found that the appeal of democracy itself was slipping as voters reported increasing economic distress and a sense that no political faction truly represents them. “Lots of factors are driving this,” Mr. Wike said, “but certainly feelings about the economy and inflation are a big factor.” Since the pandemic hit in 2020, incumbents have been removed from office in 40 of 54 elections in Western democracies, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard University, revealing “a huge incumbent disadvantage.” In Britain, the right-of-centre Conservatives suffered their worst result since 1832 in July’s election, which returned the centre-left Labour Party to power after 14 years. But just across the English Channel, the far right rocked the governing parties of France and Germany, the European Union’s biggest and most powerful members, in June elections for the parliament of the 27-nation bloc. The results pushed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a parliamentary election in the hope of stemming a far-right surge at home. The anti-immigration National Rally party won the first round, but alliances and tactical voting knocked it down to third place in the second round, producing a fragile government atop a divided legislature. In Asia, a group of South Korean liberal opposition parties, led by the Democratic Party, defeated the ruling conservative People Power Party in April’s parliamentary elections. India’s Narendra Modi, meanwhile, had been widely expected to easily sweep to a third straight term in June but instead, voters turned away from his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in droves, costing it its majority in parliament, though it was able to remain in power with the help of allies. Likewise, Japanese voters in October punished the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed the country nearly without interruption since 1955. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will stay in power, but the greater-than-expected loss ended the LDP’s one-sided rule, giving the opposition a chance to achieve policy changes long opposed by the conservatives. “If you were to ask me to explain Japan in a vacuum, that’s not too difficult,” said Paul Nadeau, an adjunct assistant professor at Temple University’s Japan campus in Tokyo. “Voters were punishing an incumbent party for a corruption scandal, and this gave them a chance to express a lot more frustrations that they already had.” Globally, however, it’s harder to draw conclusions. “This is pretty consistent across different situations, different countries, different elections – incumbents are getting a crack on the shins,” he said. “And I don’t have any good big-picture explanations for why that is.” Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said inflation has been a major driver of “the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen” - though the reasons behind the backlash may also be “broader and more diffuse.” “It could be something directly to do with the long-term effects of the COVID pandemic – a big wave of ill health, disrupted education, disrupted workplace experiences and so forth making people less happy everywhere, and they are taking it out on governments,” he said. “A kind of electoral long COVID.” In South Africa, high unemployment and inequality helped drive a dramatic loss of support for the African National Congress, which had governed for three decades since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule. The party once led by Nelson Mandela lost its parliamentary majority in May’s election and was forced to go into coalition with opposition parties. Other elections in Africa presented a mixed picture, said Alex Vines, director of the African Program at the international affairs think tank Chatham House, partially clouded by countries with authoritarian leaders whose re-elections were not in doubt, like Rwanda’s long-serving President Paul Kagame who got 99% of the vote. In African countries with strong democratic institutions, however, the pattern of incumbents being punished holds, Mr. Vines said. “The countries with stronger institutions – South Africa, Senegal, Botswana – have witnessed either a government of national unity or change of party of government,” he said. In Botswana, voters unexpectedly ejected a party that had ruled for 58 years since independence from Britain in an October election. Mr. Vines said that across the continent, “you’ve got this electorate now who have no memory of decolonization or the end of apartheid and so have different priorities, who are also feeling the cost-of-living pressures.” In Latin America, one major country stands out for bucking the anti-incumbent wave – Mexico. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, limited to a single term, selected Claudia Sheinbaum, a member of his party, to succeed him. Sheinbaum easily won the presidency in June’s election. Mr. Wike noted that Mexico is one of the few countries in Pew’s survey where voters reported satisfaction with economic conditions. Some newcomers to office have already found that the honeymoon following their victories has been short, as people have rapidly turned on them. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has seen his approval ratings plummet from a jaded electorate that wants lower prices and better public services — but is deeply skeptical of politicians’ intention and ability to deliver change. Mr. Ford, of the University of Manchester, said it’s a problem for democracy when voters, whose task is to hold governments to account, are so quick to pass judgment. “If voters are the electoral equivalent of a hanging judge, putting politicians to the gallows whether they be guilty or innocent, then what incentive is there for governments to try?” he asked. “The angels and the devils get chucked out alike, but being an angel is harder.” Mr. Trump first came to power as a challenger in the 2016 election and then lost as an incumbent in the 2020 election to Joe Biden. This year, he defeated Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, who stepped in late in the race when the president unexpectedly dropped out. Mr. Trump’s win is one of the conservative populist movement’s highest-profile triumphs. But another icon of the cause, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, saw his own party suffer its worst showing in decades in this year’s European Union election, demonstrating that no movement is safe from backlash. Mr. Nadeau, of Temple University, suggested that perhaps analysts had previously misunderstood global electoral trends – parsing them as ideological shifts - “when all along it was actually an anti-incumbent mood.” “Maybe it has always been anti-incumbent, and we were just misdiagnosing it,” he said.

One of his defining qualities was the astonishing ability to tough out marathon wins, but he clearly enjoyed playing and competing and showed humility in victory and poise in defeat. “The important legacy is that all the people I have met during these 20 years have a good human memory of me,"" said the 38-year-old Spanish superstar who will retire from tennis at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga this week. “At the end of the day, the personal issue, education, respect and the affection you can treat people with comes before the professional issue, because that is what remains.""

One of his uncles, Miguel Angel Nadal, played professional football for Barcelona, although Rafa grew up to be a Real Madrid fan.

Write Mind | Between Generosity And Prudence: Navigating India’s Immigration Dilemma,"India’s civilisational ethos is built around the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"", a Sanskrit phrase from the Maha Upanishad meaning “the world is one family."" This principle of oneness has been the guiding force for India to welcome diverse throngs huddling our lands for centuries, from the Jews who came to Bharat over 2000 years ago to the Parsis who fled persecution in Persia. The national motto “Unity in Diversity"" is a testament to India’s acceptance of plurality. But the recent influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar, especially into cities like Mumbai, has raised a debate that has made us cynics, if not question this very ethos. One group argues that untoward and unfettered immigration is a threat to national security, overburdens public resources and upsets the demographic balance. This may seem to go against India’s tradition of inclusivity, but an incisive look at the data crunched in a recent report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) reveals the complexity of the issue. The TISS report ‘Illegal Immigrants to Mumbai: Socio-economic and Political Consequences’ is a data-driven analysis of the impact of illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya immigrants on India’s financial capital. The study shows that these immigrants, mostly Muslims, have settled in 94 pockets and strategic choke points across Mumbai and have contributed to a disproportionate increase in the Muslim population. According to the report’s projections, by 2051, the Hindu population in Mumbai could decline to less than 54 per cent and the Muslim population could rise to around 30 per cent. The report also highlights the economic consequences of illegal immigration. It notes that illegal immigrants who are willing to work for lower wages are displacing local workers in sectors like construction, domestic work and street vending. Moreover, the burden on public services like healthcare, education and sanitation is huge, as illegal immigrants are using these services without contributing to the tax base.

May support BJP in Manipur again if leadership is changed: Conrad K. Sangma,"Updated - November 18, 2024 06:28 pm IST - GUWAHATI Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma. File. | Photo Credit: ANI The Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said his National People’s Party (NPP) may support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Manipur again if a change in leadership in the ethnic conflict-scarred State leads to an environment of peace. On Sunday , the NPP withdrew support from the Nongthombam Biren Singh-led government for its “complete failure” in resolving the crisis and restoring normalcy in the State. Headed by Mr. Sangma, the NPP is Manipur’s second-largest party, with seven MLAs in the 60-member House. Also read | PM Modi off on his ‘periodic foreign jaunt’, why is he ‘steadfastly refusing’ to visit Manipur: Congress “We have made it clear that our withdrawal of support was specific to him, the individual (Mr. Singh). If we see a change in leadership and a positive step forward to resolve the conflict, we can constructively cooperate and contribute to ensuring that peace and normalcy return in Manipur,” the Meghalaya CM said on Monday. He said the NPP would be happy to work with the BJP again if the party found there were efforts to end the clashes between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities that have claimed more than 260 lives and displaced some 60,000 others. “Incidents have been taking place for more than a year in Manipur but we were hopeful of a positive result. The situation deteriorated further last week, convincing our State leaders that they could not move forward [in the alliance],” Mr. Sangma said. “There may not have been a specific plan behind the violence in Manipur as such things can happen when sentiments are high. There were some efforts to contain the situation but they were not enough,” he said. He insisted that the Manipur decision would not strain the NPP’s ties with the BJP. “The decision is about Shri Biren Singh. Our MLAs and our party’s Manipur State Committee lost confidence in him and decided not to support his government,” he said. Mr. Sangma also said that as a part of the National Democratic Alliance, he had been discussing the Manipur issue with the BJP’s central leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Singh and BJP president J.P. Nadda. “I have shared with them that it is important to undertake confidence building measures and make the people trust in the system again. The overall actions being taken are not reaching a logical conclusion because of the trust deficit,” he said. “We have been stressing some trust-building measures for the government to be able to create an environment toward a positive result. This has not been done but we are hopeful,” Mr. Sangma said. The withdrawal of support by the NPP is unlikely to threaten the Biren Singh government, which has 32 MLAs in the 60-member House. The majority mark in 31. However, seven BJP legislators who belong to the Kuki-Zo community have stayed away from the State’s capital Imphal since the ethnic conflict broke out in May 2023. Their association with the party has been loose since. “The BJP will face a challenge if the Naga People’s Front (NPF), which is in the government, unlike the other parties, withdraws support. The other parties such as Janata Dal-United (JD-U) and independents can step in but they would be worried about a possible public backlash,” a political commentator in Imphal said, declining to be quoted. The NPF has five MLAs while the JD(U) has six. Manipur has three independent legislators. The NPP is now in the Opposition in Manipur, along with the Congress, which has five MLAs, and the Kuki People’s Alliance, which has two legislators.

CCI slaps ₹213 crore penalty on Meta in relation to WhatsApp privacy policy; asks co to desist from unfair business ways,"Updated - November 18, 2024 10:48 pm IST File. | Photo Credit: Reuters The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday imposed a penalty of ₹213.14 crore on social media major Meta for unfair business ways with respect to WhatsApp privacy policy update done in 2021. Besides, the competition watchdog has directed Meta to “cease and desist” from anti-competitive practices. Meta and WhatsApp have also been asked to implement certain behavioural remedies within a defined timeline to address the anti-competition issues, according to a CCI order. The regulator has called for implementing various remedial measures, including barring WhatsApp from sharing data collected on its platform with other Meta companies or Meta company products for advertising purposes for five years. Among other directions, CCI has said that sharing of user data collected on WhatsApp with other Meta companies or Meta company products for purposes other than for providing WhatsApp services shall not be made a condition for users to access WhatsApp Service in India. The Competition Commission of India (Commission) on Monday imposed a penalty of ₹213.14 crore on Meta for abusing its dominant position, Passing the order against abuse of dominance, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said this (penalty) relates to how WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy was implemented and how user data was collected and shared with other Meta companies. For the case, CCI delineated two relevant markets — OTT messaging apps through smartphones in India, and online display advertising in India. “Meta Group operating through WhatsApp was found to be dominant in the market for OTT messaging apps through smartphones in India. “Furthermore, it was also found that Meta holds a leading position compared to its competitors in online display advertising in India,” CCI said in a release. Starting from January 2021, WhatsApp notified users about updates to its terms of service and privacy policies. The in-app notification, effective from February 8, 2021, stated that users were required to accept these terms, including expanded scope of data collection as well as mandatory data sharing with Meta companies, to continue using WhatsApp. Under the previous privacy policy dated August 25, 2016, WhatsApp users were given the option to decide whether they wanted to share their data with Facebook, the release said. “However, with the latest policy update in 2021, WhatsApp made data sharing with Meta mandatory for all users, removing the earlier option to opt-out. As a result, users had to accept the new terms, which include data sharing with Meta, in order to continue using the platform,” it added. The watchdog has concluded that the 2021 policy update by WhatsApp on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the Competition Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms and sharing of data within Meta Group without any opt out. “Given the network effects and lack of effective alternatives, the 2021 update forces users to comply, undermining their autonomy, and constitutes an abuse of Meta’s dominant position. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Meta (through WhatsApp) has contravened Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act,” it said. Further, CCI said that sharing of WhatsApp users’ data between Meta companies for purposes other than providing WhatsApp Service creates an entry barrier for the rivals of Meta and thus, results in denial of market access in the display advertisement market. According to the regulator, Meta has engaged in leveraging its dominant position in the OTT messaging apps through smartphones to protect its position in the online display advertising market in contravention of the competition law.

Border-Gavaskar series: Vaughan shocked by India's call to skip warm-up matches before Australia Tests,"Published - November 18, 2024 11:43 am IST - Sydney File picture of former cricketer Michael Vaughan | Photo Credit: Getty Images Baffled by India's decision to head into the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia without a proper warm-up game, former England captain Michael Vaughan has raised concerns about how the tourists would get into a ""competitive mindset"" without match practice. India decided against playing a match against an Australian domestic side in the run-up to the five-match Test series, starting in Perth from November 22, marking a departure from their approach on the previous two tours of Australia. ""I can't get my head around a team like India only wanting to play an intra-squad game leading into a series against Australia in their own backyard,"" Vaughan told Fox Cricket. ""I just can't see how you get yourself in that competitive mindset of consequence by playing an intra-squad game. Time will tell."" But India have also called off their scheduled three-day intra-squad match with their 'A' team. They have instead opted to focus on centre-wicket training at the WACA in Perth. The Indian think tank believed that the bounce of the WACA centre strip closely mirrors that of the Perth Stadium pitch. As a result, they felt it would be beneficial for all top-order batters to spend more time in the middle. ""I'm surprised that this Indian side didn't want at least one game of cricket, and the WACA's the perfect venue because it's a similar pitch to Optus (Stadium), so you get used to the bounce,"" Vaughan said. Australia had also skipped warm-up matches before last year's Test tours of India and England, citing issues with scheduling and a lack of trust in local curators as contributing factors. ""These players have a different kind of mindset to what we had, whereas we probably needed more games,"" Vaughan continued. ""They're playing 12 months of the year and get straight into it, but it'll be intriguing to see how both sets of players settle on that first day when they're playing the longer form. ""The modern player maybe believes that they don't need (tour matches). They think they get enough cricket throughout the year and they can react and just adapt. I just like to see teams win and stick a marker down,"" he added.

Hasina is continuing her political activities from India; Delhi must return her to face trial: Bangladesh Chief Advisor Yunus,"Updated - November 18, 2024 05:48 pm IST - DHAKA Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. | Photo Credit: Suhasini Haidar Bangladesh will pursue the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, says Chief Advisor of its Interim Government Muhammad Yunus, admitting however that he had no objection to her party the Awami League contesting in elections. In an exclusive interview with The Hindu at his residence in Dhaka, Mr. Yunus spelt out his vision for ties with India and plans for reform. He defended his government’s record in 100 days since it was formed and called reports over the rise of radicalism and safety of the nation’s Hindus and other minorities “propaganda”, which has led to sharp criticism from India and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. You have finished 100 days as the chief advisor of the interim government in Bangladesh. How would you grade your government on two major issues- law and order and the economy?  Well, we are still improving on law and order, but I wouldn’t say we have got an ‘A’ yet. On the other issue- I’ll say it’s A-plus because we inherited a shattered economy. All financial institutions and banking systems nearly collapsed. It was a crazy banking system. Bad loans, 60% non-repayment. A large number of banks don’t know how to deal with each other, how to deal with the customers, and so on. So we had an almost dysfunctional financial system. So from there, we built it up, making the banking system function again. It’s not perfect yet, but they’re moving forward. Our foreign exchange reserves went down as we took over responsibility, but now have been growing month on month for the past 100 days. We were able to make our debt payments and that has improved our international image. We are trying to tame inflation down to a level where it’s tolerable. Best of all, we have gotten a tremendous amount of global support— the international community is doing business with us, assuring us of further collaboration opening the door for investments and so on. When I was in the United Nations, at the General Assembly meeting, I met so many heads of government, including President Biden and the head of the President of the European Union, and many more, who promised us financial support and also political support. We have officials who are ready to solve the problems for investors quickly so that they are not caught up in the bureaucratic process of Bangladesh, a one-stop service where you can get things done. So I would say the country is moving in a very positive way. You’ve certainly drawn a very, positive picture. But are you worried about the future— the election of Donald Trump in the U.S., for example, who issued a very strong statement criticising Bangladesh? How confident are you that international support will continue with the new U.S. administration? I don’t think President Trump has made any statement about Bangladesh.   He has, on the state of minorities... Well, that is now about Bangladesh, and on minorities, he is probably not well informed. It’s a propaganda that’s going on around the world. But when he comes to the reality of dealing with Bangladesh, Mr. Trump will be surprised at how different Bangladesh is from the impression he has been given. I don’t think just because there’s a new president in the U.S. means that everything will change. Foreign policies and country-by-country relationships don’t usually change because of a change in the President. Also, if there is a change in Trump 2.0, let us remember there is also a Bangladesh 2.0 now, what we call new Bangladesh. So we will wait, and if U.S. representatives come and check with us, and if our economy is doing well, they’ll be very much interested. They are the largest government buyers from Bangladesh, so from our side, it’s a very good relationship that we’ve built over years. Our hope is that it will be strengthened. You referred to what Mr. Trump said as propaganda- but it’s not just him. The Indian government has put out a number of statements expressing concern about how Hindus are being targeted, homes burnt, killings in certain cases, even suspected rape. How do you respond to that?  In my first phone call with Prime Minister Modi [On August 16], that’s precisely what he said, that minorities are being treated badly in Bangladesh and so on. I told him, very clearly, that it’s propaganda. After many reporters came here, there were some reports about some tensions, but not in the way that’s been built up in the media. Who do you think is behind it then? I don’t know, but this propaganda doesn’t fit into the reality. A very serious group of people have gone into all the cases, one by one... I have spoken to members of the minority community. They do feel scared. They do feel targeted. There are videos out on Facebook, on social media talking about the fact that Bangladesh will be a Muslim country. We do hear about people in positions of power now talking about changing the constitution to take secularism out of it. There is a sense that what is coming to Bangladesh next, and through your own government, is a much more radical form of Islam than we have seen in Bangladesh in the last 16 years. Is there something that your government can do to reassure these communities ?  Does this [image] fit me? Every single member of the cabinet either is a human rights activist who has suffered themselves, or an environmental activist, or a gender activist or other activist. So these are all activist people. If you say the words that you said in front of them, they will be shouting at you. Go through the lives of each one of the Cabinet members.  So you’re saying no one in your cabinet would push for an Islamist agenda.  Look at the life stories of each one of them. These are very dedicated people. There are women activists. If you think they are the ones who will be championing the kind of rule that you’re describing. There are other concerns— According to figures released by Human Rights Group Adhikar— 841 people were injured in political violence, and eight died in extra-judicial killings just in September. We hear many journalists have had their accreditations cancelled…some would say your government is continuing the behaviour of the past. Let people judge, and compare what this government has done, and what the other government has done. I’m not going to debate. We have ensured press freedom. There’s no doubt about it. The accreditation law was not made by us. We just applied it, and you can debate about it, whether it is a correct application. I would like to change that law. That was a law which belonged to some other kind of regime.  Another worry is that people associated with the previous government will be targeted for political revenge. Are there mechanisms you can put in place to ensure that doesn’t happen? I would say let the rule of law prevail. That’s it. You have set up so many commissions for reform— why not a commission on minority rights?  We do have a commission on human rights— and why should minorities go separately? I said [to the minority groups], you are a citizen of the country. You have every right guaranteed by the Constitution. We all want human rights to be established and all the rights that the Constitution gives us. See who is on our Constitution commission, and who heads it (U.S.-based academic Ali Riaz) and then try to reconcile with what you are saying…otherwise this is allpropaganda. If it is believed in a country like India, that’s right next door, or in the United States, has your government then failed to convince people it is propaganda ? Maybe we don’t have that kind of clout or money power to convince the world otherwise.   You have not so far met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, although you have spoken on the telephone… Yes, that’s something that hasn’t happened yet. when I came to the UN General Assembly, Mr. Modi had left. I attended the CoP in Baku, but he wasn’t there, BIMSTEC [in Thailand] was cancelled, and neither of us travelled for the Commonwealth CHOGM meet. But that doesn’t mean that we are not going to meet. We are not only neighbours, history has brought us together. Geography has brought us together. Linguistic relationships have brought us together. Cultural links bring us together. From day one, I have proposed to PM Modi to revive the SAARC. Why should it be a dead body? I even suggested that all SAARC leaders could meet in New York, just for five minutes to send out the message that we are still there. India and Bangladesh now cooperate on BIMSTEC, BBIN. So why SAARC? .  Why not SAARC? The more friends and relationships we can make, the better. Because with SAARC, India and Pakistan have what seems to be irreconcilable differences… SAARC must go on… It shouldn’t be that the whole group disappears only because of one relationship between two countries. We can pass a resolution, suspend any India-Pakistan issues from the agenda, but we can’t end SAARC. Was it then a mistake for Bangladesh in 2016 to support India in suspending SAARC until terrorism ends?  If we put such conditions, no relationship will ever exist. Why should all other South Asian countries suffer because of the relationship between two member countries?  When it comes to the bilateral relationship between India and Bangladesh, how was it affected by the events of August 5? Was it a blow?  Why should it be? India should be celebrating as a friendly country that Bangladesh was liberated from a rule where people suffered, so many were killed, so many disappeared, and so many institutions were destroyed. It should join our young people and celebrate together, like many other nations do. You have said that Ms. Hasina’s presence in India since August 5 poses difficulties for ties… [Former PM Hasina’s] living in India, at least for the time being, is not a problem. Talking to Bangladesh is the problem. She is talking to Bangladeshi people, and it is political. She is continuing her political activities, which is the problem. In what way? She is asking for them to come out and demonstrate on the streets of Dhaka and other cities, and her audio is being circulated, telling them to hold pictures of [U.S. President-elect] Donald Trump [as shields], so that if the police stop them, they will say the Bangladesh government is against the U.S. This is interfering with the internal and external matters of another country. Your government has approached Interpol with a request to bring her back- why not request India directly? There are bilateral mechanisms to invoke. We will use all legal means to get her back. And yet, your government has not actually asked for an extradition. There’s an extradition treaty.  I think there are legal steps which we are taking towards that, but we have not come to that stage yet.  What if India does not accept the request, invoking clauses on political prosecutions? Are you saying India would violate the treaty? Yes, there are such clauses, but if the Indian government were to use them to keep [Ms. Hasina] there, that will not make a very happy relationship between us. Our interim government is very short-lived, so it may not be able to settle everything between Bangladesh and India. But this will not be forgiven by any government that comes after us. Do you foresee India-Bangladesh ties moving smoothly on other issues? Recently we have seen some initiatives on energy connectivity, trade connectivity etc. Our dream is imagining a relationship like the European Union [with freedom of movement and trade]. That’s the direction we want to go. What you mentioned are good signs and the direction we would like to move in, but far away from what we want to achieve, which is union of very close ties. We are born to be together. We are twins. How “short lived” is your government? When do you foresee elections? When we were given the responsibility, it was made clear to us, that we wouldn’t just be a caretaker government, that comes in, holds an election and hands over. We were told that our major responsibility is reform for Bangladesh, 2.0. We didn’t want to stay for long, so we came up with this formulation. The election process began right from day one, as a separate process, and the other process of reforms will move in parallel. Now, first of all, we have created the Election Commission, which is a long, drawn process, and we expect to announce in the coming weeks, the chief election commissioners who will form an independent entity to hold elections. But they cannot hold an election until some other reforms happen- the Commission for constitutional reform will need to decide on whether we will have a bicameral parliament, whether will Bangladesh have proportional representation, terms and term limits and so on. I would say the train for elections has left the station, but along the way, we have to put the rail down in which direction it will go and that’s why we have to go back to the reform commissions. Could this take a few years? I have no idea. People would like to see an elected government, so we will be in a hurry to make the consensus as fast as possible. Will the Awami League be allowed to contest elections?  This is already announced. We didn’t want to take decisions about the political party, and the BNP (Bangladesh Nationalist Party) has done that, saying that all political parties must contest elections. So they already made the verdict, and we cannot defy the opinion of a major party of the country.  So you have no objection to the Awami League contesting?  I’m not a politician to choose one party or another party. I am facilitating the politicians’ wishes.  You did try to start your own party several years ago (in 2007)… That was just for 10 weeks, and then I held a press conference and shut it down. Many people put pressure on me, saying that people need a change. We even named the party but that was about it. Even so for the rest of my life I have accused of wanting a political party.  You don’t see yourself as a politician? I don’t see myself as a politician ever.

Vijay To Contest 2026 Tamil Nadu Elections From A Seat In Dharmapuri District?,"In a twist to Tamil Nadu’s political landscape, sources suggest that actor-turned-politician Vijay is gearing up to contest in the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. According to sources, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) has already started laying the groundwork for the upcoming state assembly polls, with significant focus on local issues and engaging with the electorate. During a meeting of the Dharmapuri district advisory team on Sunday, district president Siva said that Vijay was considering contesting in one of the five assembly constituencies in the region, further raising speculations about the actor’s electoral ambitions. In recent years, Tamil Nadu’s political scene has been dominated by a two-party contest, with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) regularly alternating in power. While many still see the DMK and AIADMK as the main political forces, the entry of TVK has introduced new uncertainties about the distribution of votes and possible alliances. Since his announcement, Vijay has been actively building his political base, drawing attention with his public statements and policy announcements. His growing influence suggests that the upcoming election may no longer be a straightforward battle between the two major parties, but could involve multiple contenders vying for power. During its Sunday meeting, the TVK criticised the MK Stalin-led state government over issues of law and order, urging it to take immediate action on several key fronts. The party called for the long-awaited caste survey to be conducted, demanded the cancellation of the controversial Parandur airport project, and pressed for a time-bound closure of liquor outlets across the state. In a broader political statement, the TVK voiced strong opposition to the BJP-led central government, condemning the Waqf Amendment Bill 2024, currently under review by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. The party described the bill as an “attack on federalism"" and called for its immediate withdrawal. Further challenging the Centre’s policies, the TVK rejected the ‘One Nation, One Election’ proposal, labelling it a direct threat to democratic values. The party strongly condemned any attempt to implement this plan, arguing that it undermined the federal structure and the democratic process. In its first meeting of district office bearers and executive committee members, TVK focused on ‘strengthening’ its organisational framework and reaching out to the public.     LATEST BLOGS"

"Now, YSRCP leaders file police complaint for derogatory social media posts","Published - November 18, 2024 04:44 pm IST - TIRUPATI Former MLA and YSRCP in-charge for Tirupati and Chittoor districts, Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, files a complaint with the Tirupati East Police on Monday (November 18). Member of Parliament M. Gurumoorthy, former ministers R.K. Roja and K. Narayanaswamy, city Mayor R. Sireesha Yadav are seen. | Photo Credit: K V Poornachandra Kumar A delegation comprising senior YSR Congress Party functionaries submitted a complaint at the Tirupati East police station here on Monday (November 18), demanding action against the social media activists who had depicted their party president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in poor light. The action comes on the heels of the scores of complaints filed by leaders of the ruling TDP and Jana Sena Party last week, prompting police action against the social media activists owing allegiance to the YSR Congress Party. Former MLA and former chairman of TTD Trust Board Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, who is currently the convenor of the party’s Tirupati and Chittoor district units, led the delegation to the station. However, the YSRCP leaders complained that they were deliberately made to wait and meted out a raw deal by the police. It was only after pressure exerted in the form of slogan shouting that the policemen accepted their complaint, it was alleged. Speaking to the media later, Mr. Reddy explained that a section of the social media handles, which aligned with the ruling dispensation, was bent on deliberately tarnishing the image of former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his family members, by dwelling on their personal issues. Responding to the alleged cold response by the policemen on duty at the station, he expressed anguish saying: “We wonder if the department is used to serve the public or harass the rival party leaders.” Meanwhile, Member of Parliament M. Gurumoorthy has said he would move a privilege motion against the police officials for refusing to accept a complaint submitted by the YSR Congress leaders against the social media handlers. He said it pained him to see the slew of posts depicting Mr. Jagan in bad taste and demanded the police to act tough against the perpetrators. “Nobody came forward to take our complaint for nearly 40 minutes. Even after we submitted the same, no receipt was given to us,” Dr. Gurumoorthy said. Former Deputy Chief Minister Kalathuru Narayanaswamy and ex-Minister R.K. Roja accused the ruling Alliance government of resorting to political vendetta and warned of backlash if their patience was taken for granted. City Mayor R.

Bangladeshi ex-ministers face ‘massacre’ charges in court,"Published - November 18, 2024 11:04 pm IST - Dhaka Police personnel escort detainee Zunaid Ahmed Palak (C), former junior Information Technology Minister and a member of Bangladesh’s ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League party, to the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) court in Dhaka on November 18, 2024. | Photo Credit: AFP Thirteen Bangladeshi former top government officials arrested after the revolution in August appeared in court Monday (November 18, 2024) accused of “enabling massacres”, with prosecutors repeating extradition demands for exiled ex-leader Sheikh Hasina. Dozens of Hasina’s allies have been taken into custody since her regime collapsed, accused of involvement in a police crackdown that killed more than 700 people during the unrest that led to her ouster. Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said the 13 defendants, who included 11 former ministers, a judge and an ex-government secretary, were accused of command responsibility for the deadly crackdown on the student-led protest that ousted the regime. Ms. Hasina, who fled to old ally India by helicopter on August 5, was also due in court in Dhaka on Monday (November 18, 2024) to face charges of “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity”, but she remained a fugitive in exile. “We have produced 13 defendants today, including 11 former ministers, a bureaucrat, and a judge,” Mr. Islam, the chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal, told reporters. “They are complicit in enabling massacres by participating in planning, inciting violence, ordering law enforcement officers to shoot on sight, and obstructing efforts to prevent a genocide.” Around half a dozen lawyers supported the defendants, who were brought from custody and led into court surrounded by a ring of security forces to separate them from the large crowd outside. Ms. Hasina’s 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents. The charges the 13 face are so far limited to the police crackdown on student-led protests, but Mr. Islam requested more time to compile evidence stretching back further. “The crimes that led to mass murders and genocide have occurred over the past 16 years across the country,” he told reporters. The court gave prosecutors until December 17 to submit their investigation report. The defendants listened to the charges read to them but were not asked yet to give a plea. At one point, former industry minister Kamal Ahmed Majumdar stood up and spoke, appealing to the judge that he wanted “to say something”, an AFP reporter in the court heard. He was not allowed to speak further. Others in court included once powerful ex-law minister Anisul Huq, former Supreme Court judge Shamsuddin Chowdhury Manik, and former energy adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury. Former social affairs minister Dipu Moni is the only woman among the 13. Mr. Islam said efforts are being made to bring 77-year-old Ms. Hasina to Dhaka for trial, a day after interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh was seeking her extradition. Islam said they had contacted Interpol “seeking assistance in arresting her, as she has committed crimes against humanity”. Red notices issued by the global police body alert law enforcement agencies worldwide about fugitives. India is a member of Interpol, but the red notice does not mean New Delhi must hand Hasina over as each country applies their own laws on whether an arrest should be made.

"India Vs Malaysia Football Live Streaming: How To Watch For Free, Probable XIs, Full Squads And More","India Vs Malaysia Live Football Streaming details: India and Malaysia square off in an international friendly tonight which will be their 33rd meeting. The two Asian rivals first met on the football field back in 1957 when India secured a 3-0 win.

Media management training for Guyanese journalists begins in Hyderabad,"Published - November 18, 2024 07:25 pm IST - HYDERABAD A two-week training programme on media management for journalists and media professionals from Guyana began at Dr. MCR HRD Institute in Hyderabad on Monday. A two-week training programme on media management for journalists and media professionals from Guyana began at Dr. MCR HRD Institute in Hyderabad on Monday. The initiative is sponsored under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme by the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. Highlighting the programme’s significance, Shashank Goel, Director-General of the institute and Special Chief Secretary to the Government of Telangana, underscored the role of journalism and media relations in democratic societies. “For Guyana, a nation with a vibrant cultural heritage and a dynamic media landscape, equipping media professionals with essential knowledge, skills, and abilities has become critical,” he noted. He further highlighted the evolution of media, from traditional outlets such as newspapers, radio and television to the rapid emergence of social media platforms such as Facebook, X, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn. He pointed out how these platforms have revolutionised journalism by offering unprecedented speed and global reach. “Additionally, Artificial Intelligence is transforming the news industry, from content creation to audience engagement. However, these advancements also bring challenges such as misinformation and fake news, threatening journalistic integrity and public trust,” he added. The Guest of honour, Rohan Singh, Officer on Special Duty at the Ministry of External Affairs, highlighted the impact of the ITEC programme. He said that since its inception in 1964, ITEC has trained approximately 2.25 lakh professionals from 160 partner countries, sharing India’s expertise across 40 disciplines. “The programme combines classroom sessions with field visits to provide Guyanese media professionals a comprehensive understanding of media management,” said course director Madhavi Ravulapati.

Biden allows Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range missiles: U.S. official,"Updated - November 18, 2024 08:04 am IST - Washington, D.C. The decision comes as Mr. Biden prepares to hand over power to President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to bring the conflict to an end in “one day” in a negotiation that is expected to require Ukraine to relinquish territory. File | Photo Credit: AP U.S. President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use long-range American missiles against military targets inside Russia, a U.S. official told AFP on condition of anonymity on Sunday (November 17, 2024), marking a major policy shift long demanded by Kyiv. The New York Times and The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, first reported the change, saying it came in response to North Korea deploying troops to help Moscow's war effort. The U.S. official who spoke to AFP confirmed the reports as accurate, while spokespeople for the State Department, White House, and Pentagon declined to comment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently pushed for authorization from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials as ATACMS, to hit targets inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that approval would mean that NATO was “at war” with his country — a threat he has made previously when Ukraine’s Western backers have escalated their military assistance to Kyiv. “The change in stance from the outgoing Biden administration was sparked by the arrival of North Korean troops in Russia, with Western intelligence reports suggesting around 10,000 are being deployed,” the U.S. newspapers said. The decision comes as Mr. Biden prepares to hand over power to President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to bring the conflict to an end in “one day” in a negotiation that is expected to require Ukraine to relinquish territory. U.S. officials had previously said they believed the ATACMS missiles would make only a limited difference to Ukraine's campaign and they also wanted to ensure that Washington's own stocks of the munitions were not depleted. The American shift is likely to have wider repercussions and lead European allies to review their stances. France and Britain have provided Ukraine with their long-range missiles known, respectively, as Storm Shadow and SCALP, but have held back from authorizing their use inside Russia without American approval for ATACMS. During a meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron on Monday (November 18, 2024), Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain discussed how to put Ukraine in “the strongest possible position going into the winter,” his office said afterward. Speaking in Argentina on Sunday (November 17, 2024), Mr. Macron said Mr. Putin “does not want peace” and that “it’s clear that President Putin intends to intensify the fighting.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to supply Ukraine with his country's Taurus missiles with a range of over 500 kilometers (310 miles) over fears that they could hit Russian territory. In the final two months of the Biden administration, U.S. officials have promised to spend the remaining $6 billion of approved Ukraine funding before Mr. Trump takes office on January 20, 2025. During campaigning, Mr. Trump and his allies consistently criticised Western assistance for Kyiv. Mr. Trump’s pick for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, said recently that “pouring more billions in (to the war in Ukraine) is the definition of insanity at this point.” Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has even mocked Mr. Zelenskyy online, sharing a clip on Instagram last weekend that said he was just weeks away “from losing your allowance.” Russia pounded Ukraine on Sunday (November 17, 2024) with a massive attack that killed 11 civilians across several regions and damaged the country's already fragile energy grid. Nationwide emergency power restrictions would be implemented Monday ahead of a much-feared winter, the state grid operator announced.

China says it stands ready to deliver on Modi-Xi common understandings to improve ties,"Advertisement BEIJING: China on Monday said it stands ready to deliver on important common understandings reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the recent BRICS summit leading to a thaw in the relations frozen for over four years due to military standoff at Eastern Ladakh. ""Recently, President Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the margins of the BRICS summit held in Kazan,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a media briefing here while responding to a question on the likelihood of a meeting the two leaders on the sidelines of G20 summit in Brazil. ""China stands ready to work with India to deliver on the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and cooperation and enhance strategic mutual trust,"" he said, adding that he has no information on the specifics of the meeting of the leaders and officials. At their Kazan meeting, the two leaders endorsed the India-China agreement on patrolling and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and issued directions to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms, signalling attempts to normalise ties that were hit by a deadly military clash in 2020. In the nearly 50-minute meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit at Kazan, Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility in border areas and that mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should remain the basis of the relations. Xi said China-India relations are essentially a question of how the two large developing countries and neighbours, each with a 1.4-billion-strong population, treat each other. China and India should maintain a sound strategic perception of each other and work together to find the ""right and bright path"" for big, neighbouring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side, he said. The ties between the two Asian giants nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. On Oct 21, India and China firmed up an agreement on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, in a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff. Both leaders also instructed the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question to meet at an early date and to continue their efforts to address the issues related to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). India's Special Representative for the dialogue is NSA Ajit Doval while the Chinese side is headed at the talks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Special Representatives mechanism was constituted in 2003. The two sides held 20 rounds of talks since then. The last meeting was held in 2019.

"Indian boys trapped in cyber fraud cells beaten up, given electric shocks in Myanmar","Advertisement NEW DELHI: Eight months ago, 22-year-old Ajay from Lucknow left after being offered a job in a call centre in Malaysia but was forced into a cyber fraud centre in Myanmar, where he continues to suffer torture and beatings, while his two friends have since returned to India. The call centre is called JPark in Meghalahpo and is said to be very close (around 2 km) to the Thailand border. ""There are six Indian boys who are presently held up in that centre, while 72 of us who were shifted to another centre called Dongmae managed to return back to India. I have heard about Ajay being tortured and kept in a dark room for days on end, given electric shocks and kept without food. I wish he returns home safely as we had left together,’’ said 25-year-old Rahul who managed to return in September. When Rahul returned he suffered from dengue and survived after undergoing treatment. TNIE had written about these three boys on July 14 this year. Ajay's family is poor and cannot afford to pay the money that is being demanded for his release. At the same time they worry about his health and safety. ""He has been mercilessly beaten, kept in a dark room and given electric shocks. We have been writing to all the concerned officials continuously since we learnt of how he was trapped but its all been in vain until now. His old parents are waiting to see him oblivious of what he is going through,’’ Ram Janam, Ajay’s brother-in-law told this newspaper. According to those boys who have returned these call centres are being illegally operated by the Chinese but the local Myanmar people assist them in ensuring that the boys don’t escape. Boys and girls of different nationalities have also ended up working in such calls centres. Indian officials are continuously trying to ensure the safe return of those who are trapped. Access to the cyber centres becomes a hindrance at times, but officials say that they would work relentlessly till the last Indian returns to his homeland.

"Mediapersons being silenced using laws, says Shamseer","Updated - November 18, 2024 09:34 pm IST - KOZHIKODE Speaker A.N. Shamseer with the recipients of the journalism awards presented by the Calicut Press Club in Kozhikode on November 18. | Photo Credit: K. Ragesh Legal provisions are being used to silence mediapersons in the country, Speaker A.N. Shamseer has said. He was here on Monday (November 18) to give away journalism awards instituted by the Calicut Press Club. Mr. Shamseer said that journalists were being haunted in the name of press censorship and laws related to Information Technology. For the past 10 years, the state had been telling them to surrender or get ready to see their institutions swallowed up by bigger corporates. A large number of mediapersons were facing attacks from various sources. The country, with a strong Constitution that guaranteed freedom of expression and personal liberty, was hanging its head in shame before the world. Mr. Shamseer said the news media should act like a corrective force and tell the truth without fear or favour. “You can criticise the government, but it should be constructive, not destructive. Certain news channels air ‘breaking news’ without verifying facts. Questions should be posed courteously. Often, prime-time television debates are becoming cross-examination sessions,” he added. B.L. Arun (Manorama News) was presented with the P. Unnikrishnan memorial award in general reporting (television), and T. Soumya (Mathrubhumi) and Attlee Fernandez (Malayala Manorama) were given away the Mushthaq memorial award for sports reporting and sports photography, respectively.

"Vidyalaxmi education loan scheme: List of eligible institutions, comparison with other schemes","Updated - November 18, 2024 08:07 pm IST PM Vidyalaxmi scheme offers education loans to students in 860 quality higher education institutions with interest subsidies and digital application process. Photo from an education loan mela in Tamil Nadu | Photo credit: L. Balachandar / The Hindu PM Vidyalaxmi, the new scheme for education loans for students, differs from previous such central government schemes in the number of institutions eligible, mode of processing of loans, the income cap, and the amount of money to be disbursed. The government has said that students who have gained admission in 860 quality higher education institutions, as defined by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), are eligible for the loans. Below are searchable tables that we have parsed so students can check if the institution of their choice is eligible for the loan. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved a new Central Sector Scheme, PM Vidyalaxmi, on November 6, 2024. It seeks to provide financial support to meritorious students in their pursuit of higher education. A government press release says that a student who secures admission in any of the 860 Quality Higher Education Institutions (QHEIs) will be eligible to get collateral-free, guarantor-free loan from banks and financial institutions to cover the full amount of tuition fees and other expenses related to the course. The scheme will potentially cover 22 lakh students, a Ministry of Education spokesperson said. For loans up to ₹ 7.5 lakh, the student will receive a credit guarantee of 75%, enabling banks to extend education loans to students. In addition, for students with annual family income of up to ₹ 8 lakh, and not eligible for benefits under any other government scholarship or interest-subvention schemes, 3% interest subvention for loans up to ₹ 10 lakh will be provided during the moratorium period. The interest subvention support will be given to one lakh students every year. Preference will be given to students from government institutions who have opted for technical or professional courses. “An outlay of ₹3,600 crore has been made during 2024-25 to 2030-31, and 7 lakh fresh students are expected to get the benefit of this interest subvention during the period,” the Ministry added. The scheme will be applicable to all government and private institutions ranked within the top 100 in NIRF rankings in overall list as well as all institutions in the category-specific and domain-specific lists. In addition, all State government-run HEIs placed between 101 and 200 in the rankings and all Central government-governed institutions will be eligible. This list will be refreshed annually with the latest NIRF rankings. Professor O R S Rao, Chancellor, ICFAI University, Sikkim, who helped to compile the list of universities eligible for the scheme, says the list does not feature 860 unique institutes as some are ranked in multiple categories. An institute has to register for the ranking as a prerequisite to feature in the rankings. While some institutions apply to a single category, some others apply for multiple categories and hence feature on more than one list. As a rule, data availability of a minimum of three years for the course is mandatory for consideration in the rankings. So universities with courses started only two years ago are not considered.   While the government has specified that they will include State government-run HEIs placed between 101 and 200, this year the NIRF ranks only 50 state government-run HEIs overall for all ranking categories. This year, when compared to 2023, the rankings have introduced a few new categories, like skill and open universities. These, however, are not eligible to be covered by the Vidyalaxmi scheme, says Prof. Rao.  Prof. Rao lauds the interest subsidies, the digital-first approach and collateral-free and guarantor-free offerings of the loans. He says that a speedier approval and disbursement of the loans is needed as the 2024-25 academic year is already underway. There is also a need for more clarity and transparency in the modus operandi for approval of the loan applications and selection of beneficiaries for interest subvention.  Digital - Students can apply for the loans through the dedicated Vidyalaxmi portal, which simplifies the loan applications and links with all major public sector as well as private banks and also facilitates tracking of their loan status. Furthermore, funds disbursement leverages Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) wallets and E-vouchers. Income groups: While previous schemes such as the Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme (CSIS) and the Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans (CGFSEL) under the PM-USP offered benefits to low-income groups, Vidyalaxmi scheme expands coverage to middle-income families too, irrespective of other factors such as caste. Vidyalaxmi has a higher income cut-off. Eligible institutions: For the CSIS and CGFSEL, the eligible institutions needed to be accredited with the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The institutes approved by Medical Council of India (MCI) and the Bar Council of India (BCI) too were considered along with Institutions conferred the status of National Importance (INI) and Centrally funded Institutions. With 820 universities of NAAC and 15,501 colleges, along with 3,348 NBA Institutions, the total was about 20,000 institutions. Hence there has been a drastic reduction in the case of Vidyalaxmi that covers only 860 NIRF ranked eligible. The breakup of 860 HEIs for Vidyalaxmi scheme from NIRF is as follows: Overall Ranking 100, Universities 100, State Universities 50, Engineering Colleges 100, Degree Colleges 100, Management Colleges 100, Pharmacy Colleges 100, Architecture & Planning Colleges 40, Law Colleges 40, Medical Colleges 50, Dental Colleges 40, and Agriculture and Allied Sector Colleges 40. There is considerable overlap in the lists and the total number of unique institutions is less than 600. The NIRF rankings have an overall category in which 200 institutions are ranked. Indian Institute of Technology Madras retained its first position in the Overall Category of India Rankings 2024 for the sixth consecutive year, i.e. from 2019 to 2024.

Amit Shah To Hold Another High-Level Meeting; BJP MLAs To Meet Manipur CM Amid Unrest,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who cancelled his election rallies in Maharashtra to review the Manipur security situation yesterday, is expected to hold another round of detailed meetings with top MHA officials today. Large-scale violence erupted in parts of the Imphal Valley districts on Saturday as mobs attacked the residences of several MLAs and destroyed property over the recovery of bodies of women and children. Yesterday, Shah reviewed the security situation in Manipur and directed the MHA officials to take all possible steps to ensure peace in the Northeastern state. The Home Ministry said that the security forces have been directed to take necessary steps to restore order and peace in Manipur as the security situation in the state has remained fragile for the past few days. It further stated that armed miscreants from both communities in conflict have been indulging in violence, leading to loss of life and disruption of public order. “Strict action will be taken against anyone attempting to indulge in violent or disruptive activities,"" the ministry said in a statement. The BJP MLAs are expected to hold a review meeting on the Manipur situation with Chief Minister N Biren Singh today at 6 pm at the latter’s residence, officials aware of the matter said.

Two cheers for the top court’s ‘bulldozer’ judgment,"Updated - November 18, 2024 12:49 pm IST ‘The judgment reads like an indirect approach to the actual problem at hand’ | Photo Credit: The Hindu Last week, the Supreme Court of India handed down a judgment dealing with what has come to be known as “bulldozer raj”. For the last three years, in many parts of India, municipal authorities had taken to demolishing people’s homes if they were accused of an offence, especially in the wake of communal tensions or large-scale protests. These demolitions were often, although not always, communally targeted, and in their wake, politicians were seen to publicly celebrate and endorse this form of state-sponsored “vigilante justice”. In its judgment, the Court came down heavily on this practice, noting that it violated the basic principles of the rule of law, the separation of powers, and turned the executive into judge, jury, and executioner. The Court declared that no person’s home could be demolished merely because they stood accused or even convicted of an offence, and issued a set of guidelines to prevent this kind of state action. EXPLAINED | How the Supreme Court clamped down on ‘bulldozer’ demolitions While the Court’s judgment is no doubt welcome, there are a number of issues that it raises. The first is delay. This pattern of vigilante demolition of homes — what scholars refer to as “domicide” — has been taking place for at least three years now. It had begun in the wake of the Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register of Citizens protests, and has multiplied across the country since then. Many of these demolitions were challenged in courts including the Supreme Court, but it is only now that the Court chose to act. This raises serious questions about the Court’s delay in addressing such a foundational threat to the rule of law. But also, it raises questions about redress and compensation for past acts, now ruled to be illegal. In its judgment, while the Court held that state officials responsible for illegal demolitions would be held personally liable for compensation and redress, it failed to clarify how its judgment would apply to all the demolitions that had taken place so far, and how it would aid the victims of such demolitions, who have been rendered homeless. This is a significant omission. Second, it is important to understand the two-faced nature of the state on the issue of demolitions. While politicians and Ministers would celebrate these demolitions as having delivered instant justice, with a view to dog-whistling to their constituencies, the municipal authorities who were actually responsible for the demolitions and had to defend them in Court, would invoke the much more prosaic justification of “illegal” or “irregular” constructions. The state never argued in Court that it was engaged in vigilante, or retributive, demolitions. Thus, when the Court framed the main question in the case as being “whether it is permissible for the State to demolish the home of someone merely because they have been accused of an offence”, it was setting up a straw man as nobody had ever claimed that such a thing was permissible. The actual claim was that the invocation of municipal building laws and “irregular construction” was a facade to legally justify what were, in effect, targeted and punitive demolitions. In fact, a close reading of the judgment demonstrates that the Court, too, was aware of this. At one point in the judgment, it noted that if, for example, one home in a locality was singled out for demolition while surrounding homes were left untouched, that would be an indication of mala fide state action. At another point, it discussed how the demolition of an individual’s home affected their (innocent) family as well, and that “collective punishment” was impermissible under Indian law. As both these events actually happened in the recent past, it is unclear why the Court used the language of hypotheticals rather than addressing the material reality before it. The judgment, thus, reads like an indirect approach to the actual problem at hand, and reflects a hesitation on the part of the Court to identify the problem in clear terms. EDITORIAL | Razing impunity: On bulldozer demolitions and the Supreme Court This, then, brings us to the most important part of the judgment — the Guidelines — which represent the Court’s actual attempt to address the problem. A perusal of the Guidelines reveals that the Court’s objective was to prevent the state from using demolitions as a political weapon by introducing two crucial requirements into the procedure: of transparency, and of due process. The Court held that before any demolition, the state would have to serve notice upon the person whose home it proposed to demolish, and provide them with at least 15 days to reply. There would have to be a personal hearing, and even after the order of demolition became final, the affected person had a right of appeal, which again required the state to stay its hand for at least 15 days. As the entire purpose of “bulldozer raj” was to serve a form of instant “mob” justice at the instance of the state (regardless of guilt or innocence), it is to be hoped that these due process guidelines will throw enough sand into the gears of the bulldozer to preclude such actions in the future. The Court also went an extra mile and mandated transparency requirements in order to prevent “backdating” of notices (a long-standing problem). Most importantly, it introduced a “proportionality” requirement into the process: municipal officials were required to explain, in writing, why the extreme step of demolition was the only option available, and why, for example, regularisation (through payment of compounding fees), or demolishing only a part of the structure, was not possible. This requirement, once again, would make municipal officials think twice before engaging in instant demolitions. The Court gave this teeth as well, by holding that in cases of illegal demolitions, erring officers would be personally liable. These Guidelines, thus, represent a sincere and committed effort by the Court to check the menace of “bulldozer raj”. It now remains to be seen how effective they will be going forward, and much of this will depend on how other Benches will implement these Guidelines, when fresh cases come to the Court. In previous cases involving lynching and hate speech, for example, we have seen detailed guidelines. But these have been ineffective because the Court has refrained from following up on and enforcing its own judgment when violations take place. It is to be hoped that this order will not meet the same fate. Also Read | Alleged involvement in crime not a ground for bulldozing private property: Supreme Court The other thing to note is that the Court made an exception in its judgment for structures on certain kind of public land (such as abutting a railway track, or a road). A look at this exception makes it clear that it would exclude from its protective ambit, slums and informal settlements where the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of society live. If anything, it is such individuals living in permanent precarity who are most in need of the Court’s protection. There is also no reason why requirements of notice and proportionality should not apply to such individuals as well. No doubt, the Court’s mind was on punitive and targeted demolitions, as that was the case before it. However, the partial application of its judgment shows that there is a long way to go, and struggles still to engage in, when it comes to securing a meaningful right to shelter and protection from evictions for all the citizens of this country.

Unregistered docs under medical councils’ scanner,"Advertisement THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala State Medical Councils (KSMC) have intensified its crack down on practitioners displaying qualifications not officially recognised by them, as they look to curb fraudulent and unqualified medical practices and safeguard patient welfare. The Council for Indian System of Medicine has been particularly active, investigating clinics and practitioners with unregistered or unrecognised qualifications. “The law mandates that only registered practitioners can legally practice,” said council president Dr Sreekumar T D. “We deploy teams to conduct investigations, and based on their findings, decide whether to grant registration,” he said, noting that such investigations often face resistance, leading to the involvement of police for ensuring compliance. Recently, the council acted against SJ Herbo Life Ayurveda and Siddha Hospital in Kozhikode following a complaint by Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE), a public health initiative under the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP). The clinic’s doctor-promoter was summoned for violating the Kerala State Medical Practitioners (KSMP) Act, 2021. Representatives from the Ayurvedic Medical Association of India too have expressed concern over illegal practices within the medical community, and are closely monitoring unethical and unregulated activities among practitioners. While the Council for Indian Systems of Medicine focuses on alternative practices, the Council of Modern Medicine has been taking action against doctors having unregistered qualifications. The council officials said there were multiple instances where doctors were found practising without proper registration of their MBBS qualifications or additional specialisations such as MD, MS, DNB, DM, MCH, and DrNB. Some doctors were also found displaying additional qualifications not recognised by the National Medical Commission (NMC), which sets the national standards for medical practice. This is a violation of the National Medical Commission Act, 2020, as well as the KSMP Act, which mandates that all medical practitioners must be registered with the respective state medical council. Medical practitioners are required to display their council registration number, registered qualifications, and a legally attested copy of their registration certificate at the locations where they practice. Only qualifications and registration numbers officially recognised and registered with the state medical council should be used on prescriptions, letterheads, and seals.

UEFA Nations League 2024-25: Belgian coach Tedesco still believes he’s the right man for the job,"Published : Nov 18, 2024 14:54 IST , BUDAPEST - 2 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  FILE PHOTO: “I trust my qualities. I trust my staff, I trust my players. I trust the people around me. I know how hard I work,” said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco after the loss to Belgium on Sunday. | Photo Credit: REUTERS Belgium’s 1-0 defeat by Israel in the Nations League on Sunday has ramped up the pressure on Domenico Tedesco but the coach still believes he is the right man for the job. Belgium has won just two of its last 10 internationals and only avoided bottom place in its group, and relegation from the top tier, because of better head-to-head results against the Israelis. The 39-year-old has come under scrutiny since Belgium’s disappointing exit at the European Championship and while the defeat in Budapest on Sunday did little to ease the pressure Tedesco remained positive about his role. “I trust my qualities. I trust my staff, I trust my players. I trust the people around me. I know how hard I work,” he said. READ | Late goal by Shua hands Israel first win of campaign Belgium’s timid tactics have been criticised throughout the six-game campaign despite Tedesco promising a more adventurous approach after it limped out to France in the last 16 at Euro 2024 in July. “After the Euros, I told you that we have to change something in some games, we missed intensity, and that we have to try new players because if we don’t do it now we will never do it,” Tedesco told reporters. “This campaign was different because of many, many injuries.” Belgium was without a host of key players for its last group game on Sunday and lost the match late on after a horror defensive error from new cap Matte Smets. “It was a difficult game, difficult circumstances, and it’s difficult to say something harsh to this young team,” said Tedesco. “We are better equipped now to go into the next year’s World Cup qualifiers.” While his future was the subject of much debate in Belgium after the loss to Israel, Tedesco was not letting it get to him. “The negative sentiment is nothing new. I was told this is typically Belgian,” he added. “Naturally the results in the Nations League did not help but in March we have a sort of final in the playoffs to keep our place in the A League. It will be good to start the New Year with a strong focus.” COMMENTS Domenico Tedesco / Belgium / UEFA Nations League BACK TO TOP"
Naidu extends greetings on Kanakadasa Jayanthi,"Published - November 18, 2024 06:27 pm IST - VIJAYAWADA Andhra Pradesh government observes Kanakadasa Jayanthi. | Photo Credit: VISHWA KUNDAPURA Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has extended greetings on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Kanakadasa. In a post on ‘X’ on Monday, Mr. Naidu said Guru Kanakadasa was a social reformer, poet, singer, and eminent devotee of Krishna. His efforts to bring change in the society are unforgettable. Born in Karnataka, Sri Sri Sri Guru Kanakadasa was a social philosopher who brought awareness to the caste system and inequality in Rayalaseema as well. Kankadasa was a great man who reminded that everyone should respect the cultural traditions of Backward Classes (BCs) and the need to work for their upliftment. Kanakadasa’s teachings on devotion are worthy of emulation even today. “The great man was a visionary, and it can be understood from the fact that his teachings, made many years ago in a simple language, are still relevant and acting as a guiding light for society. I wholeheartedly believe that the teachings of Sri Sri Sri Guru Kanakadasa will help guide society in taking the right path. That is why the State government has issued an order to observe Kanakadasa Jayanthi across the State,” he added.

Donald Trump Meets PGA Boss And Saudi PIF Head Amid Deal Talks: Report,"US President-elect Donald Trump has met with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and Saudi Public Investment Fund boss Yasir Al-Rumayyan, leaders of the two sides deadlocked in talks over bridging the divide in men’s golf. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump, who has hosted PGA Tour and Saudi-backed LIV Golf events on his courses, played golf with Monahan on Friday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The newspaper also said Trump then sat next to the Saudi wealth fund director at Saturday’s UFC event at New York’s Madison Square Garden. A framework merger agreement was announced in June 2023 between Monahan and Al-Rumayyan to great controversy given talks were conducted in secrecy and Monahan had derided LIV for months to players to avoid having more stars defect to the upstart series that launched in 2022. Talks blew past a deadline of last December and have continued with little progress since then, leaving men’s elite golf struggling to plan a future with top talent divided between PGA and LIV. A PGA Tour spokesman confirmed the Trump-Monahan session, the Post reported. “President-Elect Trump has always been a champion of the game of golf and commissioner Monahan was honored to accept his invitation to play at Trump International,"" the spokesman told the paper in a statement. “The President-Elect and the Commissioner share a love for the game and the Commissioner enjoyed their time together,"" he added. Trump courses have hosted five LIV events since the Saudi-backed series began. PGA events had been staged at other courses Trump owns. Negotiators for the PGA Tour include 15-time major winner Tiger Woods. Trump said earlier this month he could help broker a deal between the two sides, saying on a podcast, “I would say it would take me the better part of 15 minutes to get that deal done.""

The ‘new’ Justitia and reimagining justice,"Updated - November 18, 2024 01:41 pm IST The new statue | Photo Credit: PTI The addition of the open-eyed Justitia in the Supreme Court of India has led to public debate. The ‘new’ six-foot white statue is a sari-clad ornamented goddess-like figure without a blindfold, holding scales in her right hand and a copy of the Constitution of India in her left hand. It signified, said then Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud, who commissioned the statue in October 2024, that “Law is not blind; it sees everyone equally”. This is, historically speaking, puzzling since the Bombay High Court has an open-eyed Justitia statue along with a Statue of Mercy — the open-eyed justice is as much part of colonial iconography as the blindfolded figure of justice. Explained | What does the new ‘lady justice’ statue signify? The former CJI does not tell us that allegorical images of Justitia, both with and/or without a blindfold, have existed in ancient Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultures. Martin Jay in ‘Must Justice be Blind?’ (1999) argues that iconography historians tell us that “allegorical images of justice did not always cover the eyes of goddess Justitia”. During the first and second centuries, Roman coins dedicated to justice and impartiality depicted Justitia as clear-sighted considering the merits of the cases before her. It was at the end of the 15th century, evidenced through a 1494 wood engraving of a Fool tying the eyes of Justice, that a blindfold began to be placed over the goddess’s eyes, and led to a plethora of interpretations throughout Europe. Initially, it implied that Justice was “robbed of her ability to get things straight, wield her sword effectively, or see what is balanced on her scales”. Away from this negative satirical connotation, the blindfold, by 1530, transformed into a positive emblem of equality before the law and impartiality. Like the scales, the blindfold began to imply neutrality rather than helplessness, and resisting the ‘lust of the eyes’ became a virtue to achieve the dispassionate distance necessary to render impartial verdicts. Apart from the complicated history of Justitia, it is important to ask whether the interpretation now attributed to an open-eyed justice, or to use the ableist metaphor of ‘seeing’ by the lady justice, really relates to equality, impartiality, and transparency. What is the rationale behind the lady being presented as a Hindu goddess and the statue in white colour? The inspiration is perhaps the mural that is placed between the two entrances from the judges’ wing while entering the CJI’s court. This mural is not open for public viewing. This writer was privy to it during his research on courtroom iconography, in 2015-16. It is made up of porcelain marble tiles in shades of white, yellow and green, depicting Gandhi, the Dhamma Chakra and the goddess of justice. In the mural, the goddess is placed on the right side, facing left, wearing a crown, clad in a sari and jewellery, holding scales, and appearing as a devi (goddess), very much like this statue. She holds the scales at the level of her face, with her gaze at the balance — the contemplative gaze is somewhat reminiscent of Johannes Vermeer’s painting of Justitia. The mural with an open-eyed Justitia, with a book near her waist, found theological interpretation in the former Supreme Court judge M. Jagannadha Rao’s work who interpreted it as “the book of Dharma Shastra signifying the offer of total knowledge to one and all”, in the edited volume, Supreme but not Infallible: Essays in Honour of the Supreme Court of India (2000). In ‘Interpreting the Scales of Justice’ (2017), this writer interpreted the book besides the sari-clad Justitia as signifying the Indian Constitution, rather than the Dharma Shastra, which arguably restricted access to knowledge to certain caste/gender groups (Dwija men) and denied it to ‘others’. The placement of new statues of B.R. Ambedkar earlier and lady Justitia now, and having a new emblem for the Supreme Court, ought to be contextualised in relation to caste, gender and religion-based inclusions and exclusions in recent times; especially when questions are asked of the higher judiciary on diversity and equality, attempts are being made to improve its public image. It is not surprising then that the open-eyed Justitia statue is interpreted in several ways on social media like “justice will now be given by seeing one’s caste, religious identity and political ideology”. Such an interpretation of the personiﬁcation of justice has its roots in the public desire for accessibility to higher courts by all — not only as litigants but also as lawyers and judges, as well as access to justice itself. Controversies around statues are not new. Even the history of the ‘mother and child’ statue in the Court suggests so, as this writer has demonstrated in his 2017 work mentioned above. But there needs to be a careful inclusive approach to how we want law and justice to be represented in a visual art form. Should the idea of justice itself be re-envisioned? Should justice be iconographically presented in the form of a protest, resistance, lived experience, and struggle? Should it act as a transformative legal culture signifying feminist, anti-caste, secular, equality, judicial independence — virtues also enshrined in the basic structure doctrine? Should art and aesthetics, including statues, be utilised to creatively challenge the non-independence and hegemonisation of the judiciary by a select few, and to open discussions on improving its public perception? Decolonisation must not become a driver either of a recurrence of older precolonial or newer postcolonial forms of social discriminations and state violences.

"Bank Interest Rates Have To Be Far More Affordable, Current Rates Stressful: Nirmala Sitharaman FM","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday urged banks to make loans affordable and added that the current interest rates are “very stressful"". She was speaking at an event organised by SBI. At present, India requires industry to ramp up and invest in new facilities, and added that lowering lending rates can help achieve the “Viksit Bharat"" aspiration, she added. “What is important is when you look at India’s growth requirements, and you can have so many different voices coming out and saying the cost of borrowing is really very stressful, and a time when we want industries to ramp up and move (to) building capacities, bank interest rates will have to be far more affordable,"" Sitharaman said. Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal last week urged the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates to boost economic growth. He also suggested looking through food prices while deciding on monetary policy. It can be noted that most of the commercial banks are tied directly or indirectly to the RBI’s calls on interest rates, with the majority of loans using the repo rate as an external benchmark to which loan prices are pegged. The consumer price inflation overshot the RBI’s comfort level of 6 per cent, with the 6.2 per cent reading for October dashed hopes of a rate cut soon. Sitharaman said a set of three or four perishable commodities is driving the headline inflation, currently, and the rest of it, the core items, are at manageable levels of three or four per cent. The finance minister also made it clear that she does not want to get into the debate of whether food prices should be considered while constructing the inflation indices or to take calls on rates by the RBI’s monetary policy committee. Inflation is a complex issue which affects The common man, she said, adding that the government has been working on the supply side measures, including edible oils and pulses.

The Sachin Baby Story: From not knowing about Ranji Trophy to becoming Kerala’s all-time top-scorer,"Published : Nov 18, 2024 12:23 IST , ROHTAK - 9 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  FILE PHOTO: Kerala captain Sachin Baby is now the state’s all-time top-scorer in all three formats. | Photo Credit: NIRMAL HARINDRAN / THE HINDU A few hours after being dismissed for a well-made 83 against Uttar Pradesh in the fourth round of the ongoing Ranji Trophy season, Kerala skipper Sachin Baby got a call from his former team manager Saji N. “Saji Sir told me I could have scored a hundred and that if I had done so, I could have broken the record for most runs for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy,” said Sachin, on the sidelines of the fifth-round match against Haryana in Rohtak. But, the prospect of a potential record slipped through Sachin’s mind until he was back in the middle with the bat, this time in the first innings against Haryana. As he went past 15 on the way to his 27th First-Class fifty, he broke Rohan Prem’s record of most runs for Kerala in the Ranji Trophy. He also became the state’s top-scorer in all three formats. A post shared by Kerala Cricket Association (@keralacricketassociation) The 35-year-old sees this as a culmination of a journey he started as an under-13 cricketer, who didn’t know of the existence of a competition called Ranji Trophy. “When I started, I didn’t know anything about the senior team or the Ranji Trophy, as I didn’t have much exposure. I learned about it only when I got to the district Under-17 team. That was when my dream to play in the Ranji trophy was formed. My debut Ranji match was in Thalassery. [S] Sreesanth was the captain then. I have looked at my journey ever since then, wondering how I managed to do all this. It came with a lot of hard work, dedication and sleepless nights,” said Sachin. FILE PHOTO: Rohan Prem (left) and Sachin Baby (right) in action during a Ranji Trophy match against Tripura at Perinthalmanna in 2015. | Photo Credit: THE HINDU The record is of further significance for Sachin, considering that he had modelled his game after Rohan, who was his batting partner for the state over many domestic campaigns. “As a left-handed batsman, I always used to look up to Rohan Prem. I learned a lot of things playing along with him. I am delighted to beat the record, having started out with him in my early days,” says Sachin. READ | Everything comes together for Anshul Kamboj’s ‘Perfect 10’ Over the last three seasons, Sachin has been one of the most consistent batters in the Indian domestic red-ball circuit, tallying 1660 runs in 25 innings at a staggering average of 74.61. He accumulated an exact 830 runs in both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 Ranji seasons, making him the only player to possess an 800+ tally in both these campaigns. The left-handed batter believes this is a result of the continued trust he has laid in his hard-drilled technique while amplifying efforts to enhance his mental and physical steel. “After scoring 800 each in the last two seasons, I am now tagged a red-ball cricketer. When I performed in the white ball in the past, I was called a white-ball cricketer. Initially, except for once, I could score only 300-400 a season. So, I wanted to prove to everyone and myself that I can be good in red-ball cricket also. I have worked hard for that. I trained with RH Murali Sir in Bangalore. I think what we see on the ground is just a reflection of all those efforts,” revealed Sachin. The 2024-25 Ranji Trophy campaign has been a fruitful one for Kerala so far, with the side sitting second in the Elite Group C standings. In the fifth round, it claimed three points away from home against table-topper Haryana, multiplying knockout-stage qualification hopes. A key element in Kerala’s success so far is how well its bowling has adapted to a variety of conditions. In the spin-friendly conditions back home, it squeezed wins against Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. On a green top in Rohtak, its pacers delivered the goods, bundling Haryana out for just 164 to seal the first-innings lead. Sachin is a captain brimming with pride as he credits his bowling attack as one of the most balanced in Indian domestic cricket. “We have got a great balance of pacers and spinners. Last year, we just had Jalaj [Saxena]. But this year, we had B Aparajith and [Aditya] Sarwate to support him. No other team has a balanced unit like ours at the moment. Bengal and Karnataka have a good number of fast bowlers. But, they don’t have many spinners. We are blessed in that regard,” shared a beaming Sachin. Sachin also applauded the welcoming nature of his side, which has allowed the likes of Sarwate and Aparajith to settle in quickly and contribute to the team’s quick start to the campaign. “The Kerala players are very welcoming. And that makes it easier for me [as a captain]. The guest players actually take away the opportunity of one domestic player. But they keep no dislike against them. This game demands a sense of unity and we are lucky to have an abundance of it,” said Sachin. Prior to the start of the Ranji season, the southern state witnessed the successful organisation of the inaugural season of its domestic T20 championship, the Kerala Cricket League. Incidentally, it was won by Aries Kollam Sailors, led by Sachin, who also topped the run-scoring chart with 528 runs, including a century in the final. The Kerala skipper believes the KCL will play a huge role in helping his players land deals in the upcoming Indian Premier League player auctions.

But in KCL, our matches were watched for over a month by the viewers. This will be a lot of help for the players, particularly with IPL scouts.” Sachin was also candid in admitting the emotional impact of the IPL auction, particularly for the players involved in the upcoming SMAT.

Everybody will be thinking about that auction. The auction falls on the (November) 24th and 25th and we have a [SMAT] match on the 23rd. Even when we are playing, we’ll be thinking about the auction outcomes at the back of the mind. It’s a very challenging situation emotionally.” As someone who has experienced the highs and lows inherent with an IPL auction, Sachin is also doing his bit to help his teammates cope with the associated stress. “Last year, the auction happened during the Ranji trophy. Several players were affected when they failed to get in. I talked to them and made them understand that it’s not something that we can control and if it’s meant to be, it will happen,” added Sachin.

File | Photo Credit: AFP With Brazil preparing to host the Group of 20 summit, it appears unlikely the leading rich and developing nations will sign on to a meaningful declaration regarding geopolitics: The meeting on Monday (November 18, 2024) and Tuesday (November 19, 2024) in Rio de Janeiro is overshadowed by two major wars and Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Mr. Trump administration have tempered any expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Experts instead anticipate a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger – one of Brazil’s priorities – even if it aims to include at least a mention of the ongoing wars. “Brazilian diplomacy has been strongly engaged in this task, but to expect a substantively strong and consensual declaration in a year like 2024 with two serious international conflicts is to set the bar very high,” said Cristiane Lucena Carneiro, an international relations professor at the University of Sao Paulo. After Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro’s re-election bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat – who Barack Obama once called “the most popular politician on Earth” - hosting the G20. Mr. Bolsonaro had little personal interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron. Mr. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: “Brazil is back.” Brazil under Mr. Lula has reverted to its decades-old principle of non-alignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world. That involves talking to all parties, which experts say gave Brazil a privileged position to host a summit such as the G20. But his administration’s foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows. A Brazil-China peace plan for Russia and Ukraine doesn’t call for Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine and has been slammed by Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And Mr. Lula sparked a diplomatic incident with Israel after comparing its actions in Gaza to the Holocaust. Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an America First doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues. “If we have one certainty, it is regarding Donald Trump’s scepticism towards multilateralism,” Ms. Carneiro said. Two officials from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators are standing in the way of a joint declaration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Two of them said Argentina’s negotiators have raised several objections to the draft. They most vehemently oppose a clause calling for a global tax on the super-rich – which they had previously accepted, in July – and another promoting gender equality. Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil’s key negotiator at G20, told journalists on Nov. 8 that the leaders’ final declaration should address the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, but that diplomats were still discussing how to reach universally acceptable language. “The main message, naturally, is that we need to achieve peace not only regarding these conflicts but all conflicts,” he said in the capital Brasilia, adding that Mr. Lula’s launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday (November 18, 2024) is just as important as the final statement. “The leaders’ declaration will be the crowning achievement. But, at the same time, as instructed by the president himself, we have a G20 focused on concrete actions, such as the launch of a Global Alliance Against Hunger, with a package of very concrete social programs and innovative mechanisms to meet the resources needed for implementing them.” Mr. Lula, a former trade unionist who hails from a humble background, made the fight against hunger a priority during his first two terms as president (2003-2010) both at home and abroad. The number of undernourished Brazilians fell by more than 80% in 10 years, according to a 2014 U.N. report. Mr. Lula’s hunger alliance is the only one of Brazil’s primary aims for a G20 declaration that will be obtained, according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio. “Brazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the super-rich. Only the first one has survived,” Mr. Traumann said. President Joe Biden will attend the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and then travel on to Manaus, a city in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest. It will be the first time a sitting American president sets foot in the Amazon, and the trip’s objective is to highlight “commitment to environmental protection and respect for local cultures,” according to a Nov. 12 statement from the U.S. Embassy in Brazil. White House officials insist that Mr. Biden’s visits to APEC and the G20 will be substantive, with talks on climate issues, global infrastructure, counternarcotic efforts and one-on-one meetings with global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping. Those officials say Mr. Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia’s invasion and not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Any commitments Mr. Biden makes may be overturned by the next White House administration, according to Danielle Ayres, an international relations professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. “It would mean Mr. Trump would have to be proactive and say the U.S. is not going to do something to which it signed up for internationally,” Ms. Ayres said. “That has a cost. It generates insecurity, a bad perception on behalf of the international community towards Mr. Trump.” Mr. Trump’s election may also cause other countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. Xi Jinping’s inauguration of the Chancay mega port in Peru on Thursday was perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America’s reorientation. A notable absentee at the G20 will be Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, against whom the International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him, and Russia’s delegation will be led by Sergey Lavrov. Israel is not a G20 member. “The latest G20 meetings were somewhat depleted and became just another moment for bilateral meetings of heads of government. As Mr. Putin is out, Mr. Lula managed Ukraine not to be a topic, just as much as Israel. But Mr. Trump’s election takes from Mr. Lula the chance of being the star on the stage,” Mr. Traumann said.

Eight of these seats fell vacant after their MLAs were elected as Lok Sabha MPs, while a bypoll is being held on the Sisamau seat due to the disqualification of SP MLA Irfan Solanki, who was convicted in a criminal case. In the 2022 assembly polls, Sishamau, Katehari, Karhal and Kundarki were held by the SP, while the BJP won Phulpur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan and Khair.

"Manipur: Amit Shah holds high-level security review meeting, 50 more CAPF companies to be deployed","Advertisement NEW DELHI: Amid escalated violence for the past week in Manipur, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday chaired a high-level meeting and reviewed the security situation in the state with senior officials, sources said. As this was the second meeting in as many days, sources in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said, the Home Minister directed the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and the state police to intensify their operations to restore peace and order in the state as early as possible. Meanwhile, the sources said, the government has decided to increase the presence of CAPF personnel in Manipur to help the state government in its efforts to bring back normalcy, as an additional 50 companies of Central Police Forces are being dispatched for deployment. “An additional 50 companies have been ordered to be rushed to Manipur by this week. While 35 units will be drawn from the CRPF, the rest will be from the BSF,” the source said. The new batch of 50 companies is over and above 20 companies (15 CRPF and 5 BSF), which were sent last week, the sources said. In view of the latest spurt in violent incidents in Manipur, Shah on Sunday had cancelled his scheduled multiple election campaign meetings in Maharashtra and returned to Delhi, where he reviewed the situation in Manipur in an emergency meeting with senior security officials at the North Block. Earlier last week, in a statement MHA had said that the security scenario in Manipur has been fragile for the past few days. “Armed miscreants from both communities in conflict have been indulging in violence, leading to the unfortunate loss of lives and disruption in public order. All the security forces have been directed to take the necessary steps to restore order and peace. Strict action will be initiated against anyone trying to indulge in violent and disruptive activities,” it read. Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered three cases in connection with the latest instances of violence in Manipur. Three cases, which were originally registered by Manipur Police, were re-registered by the NIA a few days ago. The cases taken over by the NIA are those related to the murder of a woman in Jiribam by armed militants, which was originally registered by the local police on November 8, an attack on a CRPF post located at Jakuradhor Karong and Borobekra police stations in Jiribam by armed militants, which was originally registered at Borobekra police station on November 11, and the burning of houses and killing of civilians at Borobekra, which was originally registered at Borobekra police station on November 11. It may also be noted here that after the latest incidents of violence in Manipur, curfew has been imposed in many districts and internet services have also been shut in some areas.

Why were the Kerala IAS officers suspended? | Explained,"Published - November 18, 2024 08:30 am IST Suspended IAS officer N. Prasanth addresses the media, in Trivandrum, Kerala, on November 12. | Photo Credit: PTI The story so far:Kerala has suspended two IAS officers, N. Prashant and K. Gopalakrishnan, citing violation of service rules. The charge against N. Prashant is that he had made ‘derogatory statements’ on social media against A. Jayathilak IAS, Additional Chief Secretary, that amounted to grave indiscipline and undermining the public image of the administrative machinery of the State. The government order stated that these remarks were ‘unbecoming of an officer’ borne in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Mr. Prashant alleged that Jayathilak had orchestrated baseless news reports against him. He refuted these allegations. K. Gopalakrishnan has been suspended for allegedly creating a religion-based WhatsApp group — ‘Mallu Hindu Officers’ — that sowed disunity and created communal formations within the IAS cadre. He had claimed that this group was created after his mobile phone was hacked. However, the suspension order stated that the police inquiry found no evidence of such hacking and that the officer had done a ‘factory reset’ of the phone before handing it over to police. Also read: Reining in civil servants in Kerala  The All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 (AIS rules) governs the conduct of IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service officers. The AIS rules provide a code of conduct for the officers. Some of the rules relevant for the current issue are briefly summarised here. Officers should maintain high standards of ethics, integrity, honesty, political neutrality, accountability and transparency. They should uphold the supremacy of constitutional values. They can participate or contribute in public media in the bonafide discharge of their duties. They shall not in any communication over any public media adversely criticise the policies of the government. They shall not have recourse to any court or press for the vindication of official act, that has been subject matter of criticism, without the previous sanction of the government. It also contains an omnibus rule that the officers shall do nothing which is ‘unbecoming of a member of the service.’ There are certain overall issues that need to be addressed. First, the rules don’t have explicit guidelines with respect to communication through social media. Second, the rules have been amended from time to time by including various new conduct guidelines that regulate both the private and official life of officers. The term ‘unbecoming of a member of the service’ however continues as an omnibus rider that can be misused/misinterpreted. It must also be borne in mind that invariably in all cases, it is the senior officers and government who enforce these rules against junior officers and hence the latter need to be protected from any such misuse. Firstly, specific rules may be added with respect to the use of social media. This may include guidelines for the nature of official content that can be posted as well the right to defend against any defamatory campaign concerning official work. Secondly, an illustrative list may be provided for the term ‘unbecoming of a member of the service,’ based on past instances where action had been taken on this basis. Officers, especially youngsters, should remember that anonymity is an important trait of civil servants. In the present day and age, social media is a powerful medium for providing publicity to various governmental initiatives. It educates citizens when used judiciously. However, officers should exercise responsible anonymity while discharging their functions and disseminating information about the same. Rangarajan.

"With 18 seats, BJP bets big on Santhal Pargana","Advertisement RANCHI: The BJP is making all-out efforts to make a dent in the Santhal Pargana region, a stronghold of CM Hemant Soren-led JMM, especially on the Bangladeshi infiltration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have spelled out areas where the alleged infiltration has taken place over the years. These are Pakur, Rajmahal, Barhait and Dumka. But JMM has called it a poll plank. All BJP leaders — Jharkhand election in-charge Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Assam Chief Minister and co-election in-charge Himanta Biswa Sarma — have promised to bring a law to check infiltration. Former CM Chamapi Soren, who joined the BJP recently, has attacked the JMM over the changing demography of Santhal Pargana. JMM patriarch Shibu Soren’s daughter-in-law Sita Soren and former JMM MLA Lobin Hembram, who recently joined BJP, also took the campaign forward. The BJP maintains it is the tribals who are suffering due to infiltration; their identity is in danger due to ‘love and land jihad.’ “Infiltrators are grabbing tribals’ land by marrying their daughters and snatching their political right by fielding their ‘tribal’ wives on the seats reserved for tribals. They interfere in the village administration after making their wives win in panchayat polls,” says state BJP spokesperson Pradeep Sinha. “The locals are now becoming increasingly aware about their roti-mati-beti (bread, land, daugthers) being in danger due to the influx of Bangladeshi people,” he added. The JMM, on the other hand, believes that the people of Jharkhand have defied the issue being raised by the BJP and the Mukhyamantri Maiyan Samman Yojana will prove to be a masterstroke and pave the way for the formation of JMM-led INDIA alliance in the state yet again. Santhal Pargana is considered the focal point of Jharkhand politics and has given three CMs to the state. Besides that, more than a dozen MLAs of this region have become ministers. Out of the total 18 seats in Santhal Pargana, seven are reserved for Scheduled Tribes and one seat for SC, while 10 seats are general seats. In the 2019 assembly elections, the JMM won 9 seats including Barhet, Borio, Littipara, Maheshpur, Shikaripara, Dumka, Jama, Madhupur and Nala in Santhal Pargana, while Congress won four seats — Pakur, Mahagama, Jamtara and Jarmundi. The BJP managed to get only four seats — Rajmahal, Godda, Deoghar and Sarath. CM Hemant Soren is again in the election fray from the Barhait seat. His brother Basant Soren is contesting from Dumka on a JMM ticket. Hemant Soren in poll fray from Barhait CM Hemant Soren is again in the election fray from the Barhait seat. His brother Basant Soren is contesting from Dumka on a JMM ticket. Barhait is considered a safe seat for JMM as it has succeeded in retaining the seat since 1990. Meanwhile, for the first time, Shibu Soren is away from the election campaign due to poor health.

"TTD to use AI to streamline queues, decides to go for comprehensive review of Srivani Trust","Published - November 18, 2024 07:53 pm IST - TIRUMALA The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Trust Board has announced a series of transformative decisions aimed at improving devotee experience and ensuring administrative transparency during its meeting held on Monday at Tirumala. Briefing the media along with TTD Executive Officer J. Syamala Rao on Monday, TTD Chairman B.R. Naidu emphasised the board’s commitment to leveraging modern technology and enhancing governance. Amid allegations of financial misuse, the board directed a comprehensive review of the Srivani Trust. It decided to study the feasibility of renaming the trust and diverting its funds to the temple’s main account. A detailed report on this matter will be discussed in the next meeting. The move follows public scrutiny, particularly from the NDA alliance, which raised concerns over the alleged misappropriation of Srivani funds. In a significant decision, the board resolved to address the issue of non-Hindu employees working within TTD. It decided to bring this matter to the government’s attention, urging it to rehabilitate these employees in other government institutions or offer them voluntary retirement options. One of the key resolutions involves employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline queue lines, reducing waiting times and ensuring that devotees complete their darshan of Lord Venkateswara within two to three hours. To achieve this, the board announced the formation of a committee of experts to recommend required measures. The board also took a firm stand to preserve the sanctity of Tirumala by announcing strict action against individuals engaging in political statements or campaigns in the temple town. Another critical decision pertained to a controversial hotel in the 20 acres of land allocated to the State Tourism Corporation in Alipiri at the foothills. The corporation in turn leased out the land for the construction of a five-star hotel inviting widespread criticism from across the country. The board resolved to end the controversy by recommending to the State government for revoking the approval granted to the project and reclaim the land for TTD use. The misuse of darshan tickets allocated to State Tourism Corporations and transport bodies, including APSRTC and TSRTC, prompted the board to withdraw the privilege. Nearly 4,000 tickets, previously issued to these organisations, will now be reassigned to regular devotees. The Visakha Sarada Peetham also came under scrutiny, with the board deciding to revoke the lease of land allocated to the mutt near Gogarbham Dam. Allegations of building violations and forest land encroachments led to the decision, with the board planning to take possession of the property. Other decisions included renaming the Srinivasa Setu flyover in Tirupati as ‘Garuda Varadhi’ and reserving the first Tuesday of every month for Tirupati and Tirumala residents to have darshan. To ensure better financial security, the board resolved to withdraw deposits from private banks and reinvest them in nationalised banks. Enhancements to the devotee experience were also on the agenda, with the board deciding to improve the quality of the famed laddus and Annaprasadam offerings, including the addition of new dishes to the menu. It also resolved to clear the garbage in the Tirumala dumping yard within three to four months and increase the Brahmotsavam bonus for employees by 10%. The Board also approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with TVS Group to address water leakage issues in the temple and modernise the Annaprasadam centres. Notably, TVS has pledged to undertake these projects at no cost to TTD.

"Centre May Send More Troops To Manipur, Ground Assessment To Decide Big Steps | Exclusive","Additional troops are likely to be deployed in Manipur — which is on the boil again — after a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. According to sources, preparations for sending additional troops are already in progress. Sources within the Manipur government have confirmed that the 20 companies sent by the Union government last week will not be sufficient, given the current tense situation in the state. Sources also hinted that following Shah’s meeting, the Centre may take major steps based on ground assessment. A senior government official told News18 that once the troops arrive, companies of CAPFs will be deployed evenly in both the hilly and valley areas to maintain law and order, with a particular focus on the valley. “Currently, in Jiribam district, which is the epicentre of recent violence, several companies have been deployed, and platoons have been sent to nearby areas that might witness further attacks. The Meitei and Kuki communities are opposing the deployment of forces. More troops will arrive in Manipur after receiving official communication,"" a top-level official aware of the development told News18. Meanwhile, DG CRPF Anish Dayal, who was asked to rush to Manipur, will assess the situation and report back to the Home Ministry. Sources suggest that Dayal will brief Shah about the situation, which will guide further action after a detailed discussion with local top officials. The DG CRPF will also visit the tense areas and assess the deployment of forces.   LATEST BLOGS"

SC issues notice to Centre over vacancies in debt recovery tribunals,"Advertisement NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Ministry of Finance on a PIL highlighting critical vacancies in Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) across India. A bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar heard the submissions of Sudarshan Rajan, appearing for PIL petitioner Nischay Chaudhary, and sought the response of the Union Ministry of Finance. The PIL raised concerns that nearly one-third of the 39 DRTs in the country are currently non-functional due to the absence of Presiding Officers, for expediting debt recovery for banks and financial institutions. The DRTs are set up under the Recovery of Dues to Banks and Financial Institutions Act of 1993 to enable banks and financial institutions to recover bad debts from borrowers. According to the PIL, as of September 30, 2024, 11 DRTs are without Presiding Officers, severely impacting their ability to resolve cases efficiently. The petitioner argues that this inaction frustrates the purpose of the 1993 law, which was enacted to ensure timely adjudication and recovery of debts. The PIL also emphasises that speedy justice is a fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, as recognised by the Supreme Court in the case of District Bar Association Dehradun vs Ishwar Shandilya in 2020. The PIL sought a direction to the Ministry of Finance to produce records relating to the selection and appointment of Presiding Officers in DRTs to evaluate the government's seriousness in addressing these vacancies. It also sought a direction to the Centre to mandate the timely filling up of existing vacancies and establish mechanisms to prevent delays in future appointments. As interim measures, PIL sought a direction that the powers of non-functional DRTs are vested in other tribunals to prevent disruption of services.

"Manipur Violence: Amit Shah Reviews Security Situation, 5000 Paramilitary Troops To Be Deployed","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday reviewed the prevailing security situation and deployment of troops in Manipur for the second consecutive day and directed top officials to focus on restoring peace and order there as early as possible, sources said. The Union Home Ministry is also rushing in about 5,000 paramilitary troops to Manipur to assist the state government in handling the current “volatile"" situation. The home minister reviewed the security situation in Manipur with top officials of the central and state governments, the sources said. This was the second consecutive day that Shah reviewed the situation in Manipur. He took stock of the deployment of central forces there and directed the officials to restore peace and order there as early as possible, they said. The situation in the northeastern state, which has been reeling from ethnic strife since May last year, has been volatile following protests and violence after the recovery of bodies of women and children. Irate mobs set fire to the residences of three more BJP legislators, one of whom is a senior minister, and a Congress MLA in various districts of Imphal Valley on Saturday night even as security forces foiled an attempt by agitators to storm the ancestral residence of Chief Minister N Biren Singh. These incidents took place even as several restrictions were imposed after people, agitated by the killing of three women and three children by militants in Jiribam district, attacked the residences of three state ministers and six MLAs earlier on Saturday.

China says it stands ready to deliver on Modi-Xi common understandings to improve ties,"Updated - November 18, 2024 08:39 pm IST - Beijing Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia on October 23, 2024 | Photo Credit: CHINA Reuters China on Monday (November 18, 2024) said it stands ready to deliver on important common understandings reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the recent BRICS summit leading to a thaw in the relations frozen for over four years due to military standoff at Eastern Ladakh. “Recently, President Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the margins of the BRICS summit held in Kazan,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a media briefing here while responding to a question on the likelihood of a meeting the two leaders on the sidelines of G20 summit in Brazil. “China stands ready to work with India to deliver on the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and cooperation and enhance strategic mutual trust,” he said, adding that he has no information on the specifics of the meeting of the leaders and officials. At their Kazan meeting, the two leaders endorsed the India-China agreement on patrolling and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and issued directions to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms, signalling attempts to normalise ties that were hit by a deadly military clash in 2020. In the nearly 50-minute meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit at Kazan, Mr. Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility in border areas and that mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should remain the basis of the relations. Also read | The LAC agreement, the détentes and the questions Mr. Xi said China-India relations are essentially a question of how the two large developing countries and neighbours, each with a 1.4-billion-strong population, treat each other. China and India should maintain a sound strategic perception of each other and work together to find the ""right and bright path"" for big, neighbouring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side, he said. The ties between the two Asian giants nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 that marked the most serious military conflict between the two sides in decades. On Oct 21, India and China firmed up an agreement on patrolling and disengagement of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, in a breakthrough to end the over four-year standoff. Both leaders also instructed the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question to meet at an early date and to continue their efforts to address the issues related to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). India's Special Representative for the dialogue is NSA Ajit Doval while the Chinese side is headed at the talks by Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Special Representatives mechanism was constituted in 2003. The two sides held 20 rounds of talks since then. The last meeting was held in 2019.

National People’s Party withdraws support to Manipur government,"Updated - November 18, 2024 08:07 am IST - GUWAHATI File picture of NPP’s national president and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma. | Photo Credit: PTI GUWAHATI The National People’s Party (NPP) has withdrawn support to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Manipur. In a letter to BJP president J.P. Nadda on Sunday (November 17, 2024), the NPP’s national president and Meghalaya Chief Minister, Conrad K. Sangma, said his party felt the Manipur government under Nongthombam Biren Singh “completely failed” to resolve the crisis and restore normalcy in the State. Amit Shah reviews security situation in Manipur Army deployed in Imphal as two more bodies found; Amit Shah reviews Manipur security after cancelling Maharashtra rallies Manipur Govt urges Centre to withdraw AFSPA “In the last few days, we have seen the situation further deteriorate where many more innocent lives have been lost. People in the State are going through immense suffering,” Mr. Sangma wrote. “Keeping the current situation in mind, the NPP has decided to withdraw its support to the Biren Singh-led government in Manipur with immediate effect,” he added. The party has seven MLAs in the 60-member Manipur Assembly and is a key constituent of the BJP-helmed National Democratic Alliance and the North East Democratic Alliance. The NPP’s withdrawal of support, however, would not have any impact on the BJP government, as the saffron party enjoys absolute majority with its 32 MLAs. The saffron camp has also the support of five MLAs of the Naga People’s Front (NPF) and six JD(U) legislators. Also Read | Houses of four more MLAs torched in Manipur, agitators attempt to storm CM’s ancestral residence On Sunday (November 17, 2024), Manipur Congress president Keisham Meghachandra Singh offered to resign as an MLA “if the people want to bring a new mandate to bring peace” in the State. He is one of five Congress MLAs and represents the Wangkhem constituency. Various social organisations in Manipur’s Imphal Valley have been mounting pressure on the Ministers and MLAs to resign after reports that six bodies of women and children abducted by extremists on November 11 were recovered. On Saturday (November 16, 2024) night, mobs went on the rampage torching the houses of at least 15 legislators, including that of Congress MLA Thokchom Lokeshwar Singh, who represents the Khundrakpam constituency. The house of PWD Minister Govindas Konthoujam of the BJP sustained the most damage.

Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024: BJP’s Subdued Campaign Strategy Meets MVA’s Regional Pride Push,"Published : Nov 18, 2024 20:15 IST - 6 MINS READ COMMENTS SHARE  Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav during an election campaign in favour of Mahayuti candidate Rajesh Khandare ahead of Assembly polls, in Mumbai, on November 2024. | Photo Credit: PTI No election in India is ever dull. While politicians may strategically modulate the intensity of their campaigns, the country’s elections consistently captivate public attention. That said, the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly election proved quieter than many political observers anticipated. This subdued tone was particularly surprising given the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) recent setback in the State’s Lok Sabha elections and the results in Haryana, which led many to expect an aggressive campaign from the BJP. However, the campaign that concluded on November 18 maintained a notably low profile. This restraint was strategic. During the Lok Sabha campaign, the BJP discovered that attacks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah on Uddhav Thackeray or Sharad Pawar triggered strong grassroots backlash. While such criticism during national elections, where neither Maharashtra leader was a prime ministerial candidate, proved costly, the stakes were even higher in the Assembly election. Given Thackeray and Pawar’s fifty-year legacy as state leaders, attacking them risked even stronger electoral repercussions. Consequently, the BJP redirected its focus toward the Congress, centering its advertising campaign on the “Why no Congress?” theme. This strategy was particularly relevant as both national parties competed head-to-head in 74 Assembly seats, where victory could determine who forms the government. The Congress recognised this strategy a bit late. Despite its alliance with NCP (Sharad Pawar) and Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, their first joint rally in Mumbai occurred only on November 6 (the election was announced on October 15). The Congress campaign gained momentum after November 14, the party leadership was involved in Priyanka Gandhi’s by-election in Wayanad, Kerala. Also Read | BJP returns to Ma-Dha-Va formula as Maratha-OBC polarisation threatens its Assembly prospects During this period, Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar led the MVA’s campaign charge, while the Mahayuti (Maharashtra’s NDA) was spearheaded by Modi, supported by Shah, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and Ajit Pawar. At his rallies, Modi talked about the government’s welfare schemes while introducing the communal slogan “Ek Hai To Safe Hai”. This followed the BJP’s post-Lok Sabha narrative about Muslim bloc voting, termed “Vote Jehad”, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s controversial slogan “Batenge To Katenge” (Divided we perish), which he repeated at Maharashtra rallies. These polarising tactics faced internal resistance, with NCP (Ajit Pawar) and BJP leaders such as Pankaja Munde and Ashok Chavan arguing that such North Indian-style communal politics were unsuitable for Maharashtra’s development-focused electorate. Recognising this discomfort among party and alliance leaders, Modi crafted the more nuanced “Ek Hai to Safe Hai” (Together, we are safe) slogan. While the BJP leaders equated this with “We Are All One,” its communal undertones remained evident, effectively delivering the party’s intended message to voters. While the BJP pushed a Hindu-Muslim narrative, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders reframed the electoral battle along sub-nationalist lines. They highlighted Maharashtra’s industrial exodus to Gujarat as a primary issue of “injustice to Maharashtra”. Leaders across the alliance, from Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi to Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar, consistently cited specific industries that relocated from Maharashtra to Gujarat in recent years. They noted that these industrial shifts could have generated 5,00,000 jobs, an important point given Maharashtra’s unemployment challenges. The MVA portrayed this as Gujarat, aided by the central government, depriving Maharashtrian youth of employment opportunities. Recognising unemployment’s centrality to voters’ concerns, the MVA’s manifesto promised 2,50,000 government jobs within six months and 1.2 million private sector positions. Meanwhile, the Mahayuti government’s Ladaki Bahin scheme, providing Rs.1,500 monthly to women aged 21-65, became their campaign cornerstone. This direct benefit transfer program arguably kept Mahayuti competitive in Mumbai, particularly following their 31-17 Lok Sabha setback. The MVA countered by promising Rs.3,000 monthly payments, along with free education through graduation, Rs.2.5 million health insurance coverage, and minimum support prices (MSP) 50 per cent above current levels. As soybean prices plummet, farmers, particularly women, bear the brunt, selling their harvests at prices far below the Minimum Support Price (MSP), igniting fiery debates in the election arena. | Photo Credit: B. Jothi Ramalingam / The Hindu The MVA’s boldest economic promise concerned soybean pricing. With market prices falling to Rs.4,000 per quintal against an MSP of Rs.4,892, the MVA pledged Rs.7,000 per quintal if elected. According to senior journalist Suhas Sardeshmukh from Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, this promise could influence voting patterns across 70 assembly constituencies in Marathwada, Vidarbha, and North Maharashtra. Though Mahayuti promised Rs.6,000 per quintal, their current position in government made farmers sceptical of this commitment. Caste dynamics, which was central to Maharashtra’s Lok Sabha campaign, remained prominent in the Assembly election as well. The Maratha community’s reservation demands, particularly their leader’s push for inclusion in the Kunbi category of Other Backward Classes (OBC), has antagonised OBCs, especially in Marathwada. The BJP sought to consolidate non-Maratha Hindu support, particularly after reservation movement leader Manoj Jarange urged his supporters to oppose the BJP and Mahayuti. This caste-based polarisation could significantly impact 95 Assembly seats. The relative strength of Maratha versus non-Maratha consolidation will likely prove decisive in determining election outcomes. Also Read | Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024: The talking heads Maharashtra politics underwent dramatic changes after Uddhav Thackeray’s government fell in June 2022, splitting Shiv Sena into two factions. Thackeray has since campaigned heavily on the issue of “Gaddari” (betrayal). Sharad Pawar’s NCP faced a similar fate, with the Election Commission granting party symbols to rebel groups—a decision both leaders portrayed as an affront to Maharashtra’s pride. The “Gaddari” narrative gained renewed prominence in these Assembly election, with both Thackeray and Sharad Pawar urging voters to defeat the “traitors”. This family drama reached its peak in Baramati, where Sharad Pawar fielded his grandson Yugendra Pawar—Ajit Pawar’s nephew—against Ajit himself, openly calling for Ajit’s defeat on grounds of betrayal. Against the backdrop of competitive welfare promises and growing caste and religious divisions, the campaign’s quality deteriorated significantly. The rhetoric employed by both local and State-level leaders departed from Maharashtra’s traditional political culture of mutual respect and warmth. While every leader invokes Yashwantrao Chavan, Maharashtra’s first Chief Minister, they seem to have forgotten his crucial message from the 1962 election campaign: “Elections are the soul of democracy. Elections give leaders an opportunity to introspect and present their vision. Elections are also times for people’s education at large. Leaders must take this opportunity to educate the people with their plans.” The 2024 Assembly election emerges as perhaps the most crucial since 1962, occurring at a time when Maharashtra faces declining industrial output, deteriorating infrastructure, and erosion of political dignity. And voters witnessed mostly personal attacks and vague promises rather than substantive debate. The election battle appeared neck-and-neck, and campaigns from all sides lacked innovation and fresh ideas. Now, Maharashtra’s 98 million voters must now make their decision based on this lacklustre campaign season CONTRIBUTE YOUR COMMENTS SHARE THIS STORY BACK TO TOP"

Bangladesh tribunal tells investigators to finish probe against ousted premier Hasina by next month,"Advertisement DHAKA: A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides, who face charges of crimes against humanity after hundreds of people were killed in a mass uprising this summer. Golam Mortuza Majumdar, the head judge of the three-member International Crimes Tribunal, set Dec. 17 for investigators to finish their work, as the tribunal heard updates Monday from police about what the country's security agencies have done to arrest Hasina and her close aides. The decision came after prosecutors sought more time for the investigation. Mohammed Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of the tribunal, told the judges during Monday's hearing that they were working in line with an extradition treaty signed earlier with India to make Hasina's return possible. Hasina has been living in exile in India since Aug. 5 when she fled the country amid the student-led protests. The Dhaka-based tribunal on Oct. 17 issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others, including former Cabinet ministers, advisers and military and civil officials. The country is now being run by an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. At least 13 people, including a former law minister and a businessman who was Hasina’s private-sector adviser, appeared before the tribunal on Monday, said B.M. Sultan Mahmud, a prosecutor at the tribunal. One former Cabinet minister was not brought to the tribunal as he was in custody for police interrogation in a separate case. A further six people will appear on Wednesday, tribunal officials said. At least 20 suspects have been arrested in the case. The tribunal will also seek updates from police on their progress in arresting the other suspects, including Hasina. After the hearing on Monday, the tribunal’s head judge ordered authorities to send all 13 suspects to jail, pending investigation. The chief prosecutor of the tribunal has already sought help from Interpol through the country’s police chief to arrest Hasina. On Sunday, Yunus said in an address to the nation that his administration would seek Hasina's extradition from India. Authorities say hundreds of people were killed during the uprising in July and August, mainly by security agents seeking to quell the initial protests over government jobs. The violence intensified as the protests morphed into an anti-government movement, with more bloodshed, ending Hasina’s 15-year rule. Hasina had also earlier sought an investigation into the killings.

Anti-trust regulator levy Rs 213 crore penalty on Meta for 'forcing' WhatsApp users to share data,"Advertisement The anti-trust regulator -Competition Commission of India (CCI)-on Monday imposed a penalty of Rs 213 crore on US tech giant Meta, which owns and operates the messaging app WhatsApp, for abuse of its dominant position. The punitive action by the CCI comes after WhatsApp forced users to mandatorily share data with other Meta companies such as Facebook. The regulator has also directed WhatsApp to not share user data collected on its platform with other Meta Companies or Meta Company Products for advertising purposes, for a period of five years. As per the CCI order, Whatsapp in January 2021 notified users that they were required to accept the new terms of services and privacy policies, including expanded scope of data collection as well as mandatory data sharing with Meta companies, to continue using the app. ""Under the previous privacy policy dated 25 August 2016, WhatsApp users were given the option to decide whether they wanted to share their data with Facebook. However, with the latest policy update in 2021, WhatsApp made data sharing with Meta mandatory for all users, removing the earlier option to opt-out. As a result, users had to accept the new terms, which include data sharing with Meta, in order to continue using the platform,” the CCI said in its order. The CCI found WhatsApp to be dominant in the market for OTT (over-the-top) messaging apps through smartphones in India, and accordingly concluded that the 2021 policy update by the app on a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the anti-trust Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms and sharing of data within Meta Group without an option to opt-out. “Given the network effects and lack of effective alternatives, the 2021 Update forces users to comply, undermining their autonomy, and constitutes an abuse of Meta’s dominant position,” concluded the regulator. On the issue of sharing of data between Meta companies, the Commission has concluded that sharing of WhatsApp users’ data between Meta companies for purposes other than providing WhatsApp Service creates an entry barrier for the rivals of Meta and thus, results in denial of market access in the display advertising market. It also concluded that Meta has engaged in leveraging its dominant position in the OTT messaging apps through smartphones to protect its position in the online display advertising market and the same is in contravention of provisions of the Competition Act.

"Gangster Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol, wanted by NIA, Mumbai cops, held in US: Sources","Advertisement MUMBAI: Jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi's brother Anmol, wanted for the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique and firing outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's home here, has been detained in the United States, Mumbai police sources said on Monday. Anmol, who was believed to be living in Canada and making regular travels to the US, is the younger brother of Lawrence Bishnoi, accused of running a global criminal syndicate despite being in jail. The sources did not provide further details related to his detention. Anmol Bishnoi is wanted in connection with several criminal cases, including the murder of NCP leader and former Maharashtra minister Siddique on October 12 in Mumbai's Bandra area. He was also allegedly behind the firing outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's home, located in the Bandra area, on April 14 this year, according to the sources. Earlier this month, an official said the Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Centre for extradition of Anmol Bishnoi, who has also been named in an FIR filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), India's counter-terrorism law enforcement agency. The proposal was sent after the US authorities informed the Mumbai police about Anmol Bishnoi's presence in their country, the official said on November 2. In October, the Mumbai police's crime branch moved a special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court, stating it intends to initiate the extradition procedure of fugitive criminal Anmol Bishnoi. It filed an affidavit for further necessary action, which was allowed by the special court. The Mumbai police have sent the proposal for Anmol Bishnoi's extradition to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which will then be forwarded to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the official had said. Both Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi, who hail from Fazilka in Punjab, have been named as wanted accused in a chargesheet filed by police in connection with the firing outside Salman Khan's Galaxy Apartment. Two motorbike-borne men, Vicky Gupta and Sagar Pal, had allegedly carried out the firing. The NIA recently announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information leading to the arrest of Anmol Bishnoi. His brother Lawrence Bishnoi is currently lodged in Sabarmati Central Jail, Ahmedabad. A lookout circular was issued in April against Anmol Bishnoi, who had claimed responsibility for the firing incident outside Salman Khan's residence. An FIR was also registered by the NIA against nine accused, including the Bishnoi brothers, in August 2022 for being part of a conspiracy to 'raise funds, recruit youth to carry out terrorist acts in the Union Territory of Delhi and other parts of the country' besides 'targeted killings of prominent persons.'

"Kailash Gahlot joins BJP, a day after quitting AAP","Updated - November 18, 2024 10:30 pm IST - New Delhi A day after resigning from the prime membership of the Aam Aadmi Party, former Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot, joined the BJP in the presence of Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and senior party leaders at the BJP headquarters, in New Delhi on November 18, 2024.   | Photo Credit:  Shiv Kumar Pushpakar Former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday (November 18, 2024) joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), only a day after tendering his resignation from the AAP. Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Delhi BJP election in-charge Baijayant Panda welcomed Mr. Gahlot to the party along with other senior BJP leaders . VIDEO | Former Delhi Minister Kailash Gahlot (@kgahlot) joins BJP in the presence of Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar (@mlkhattar) and State BJP President Virendra Sachdeva (@Virend_Sachdeva).

(Full video available on PTI Videos - https://t.co/n147TvrpG7) pic.twitter.com/U9Vdm7qucf While Mr. Gahlot’s resignation came as a surprise to the AAP, the party said he had been under pressure from the BJP. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said that Mr. Gahlot’s resignation was part of the BJP’s “dirty politics”, and that he had been under pressure from raids by the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Khattar highlighted Mr. Gahlot’s experience in Delhi. “His decision to join the BJP will surely benefit the party. Mr. Gahlot was a prominent Jat face for the AAP. A three-time MLA, he held several ministerial berths in the AAP government,” Mr. Khattar said. Senior BJP functionaries have said that Mr. Gahlot’s resignation would prompt others to follow suit as well. “There are many who are waiting in the wings to join the party,” a BJP leader said. “There is a lot of anti-incumbency against the AAP. To save their tickets, many leaders from the AAP have reached out to the leadership to join, but we are being selective,” another senior BJP leader said. Sources in the BJP said the party wanted to depend on its own cadre instead of “inducting outsiders”. As Kailash Gahlot walks out of party, BJP, Cong. fire fresh salvo at AAP “Kailash Gahlot, a prominent face of the AAP, joining the BJP proves the diminishing confidence within the AAP, which has failed to fulfil promises for the past decade,” Mr. Panda said at the press conference. He criticised the AAP’s governance, especially on issues, including the Yamuna clean-up and the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. He said that Delhiites were ready for a “double engine government” for progress and a better future. Joining the BJP, Mr. Gahlot dismissed speculation over external pressures forcing his decision. “I have never worked under pressure. The narrative being created about me is completely wrong,” he said. He said he had joined the AAP inspired by a vision to serve Delhi. However, he lamented that the AAP was no longer aligned with its founding values. “The common man has turned into the privileged man. A government that constantly fights with the Centre on every issue cannot ensure Delhi’s development,” Mr. Gahlot said.

"Virat Kohli will have his moments, hopefully not too many: Travis Head ahead of BGT","Advertisement PERTH: Australian batter Travis Head on Monday backed Virat Kohli to ""have his moments in the series"" as the Indian superstar continued to dominate talks in the run-up to the five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting on Friday. Kohli's ordinary returns with the bat this year in Test cricket notwithstanding, the 36-year-old has been the cynosure of all eyes since the Indian team landed in Australia last week. Head threw his support behind the Indian batting mainstay, who managed a mere 93 runs across three Tests against New Zealand at a forgettable average of 15.50 in his last assignment at home just before the tour of Australia. ""No doubt, we will go through all their players, cannot wait to start well against them. Virat's going to have his moments in this series, hopefully not too many of them,"" Head told the media at the Optus Stadium after Australia's training session. ""He is a world-class player. Over the course of five Tests, he is going to play well at some stage. We have to understand and respect that. Hopefully, the players on our side also have their moments in the series,"" said the left-handed batter. Head reckoned having closed-door sessions in Australia, shortly after India's unprecedented Test series defeat to New Zealand, would have allowed Kohli to find his rhythm. ""He is pretty big. Everyone talks about Virat, wherever he goes. Maybe the closed sessions give him a bit of freedom, bit of space,"" he said adding, ""There won't be a series where you would play India and you wouldn't talk about Kohli."" India captain Rohit Sharma is missing the series opener due to the birth of his second child, and Head supported his decision. ""(One) hundred per cent, I support Rohit's decision. I would have done the same in the same situation,"" Head remarked. ""We sacrifice a lot of things as cricketers. While we live a privileged life, we miss important milestones in our personal lives. You don't get that time back. Hopefully, he returns at some stage in this series."" Despite India's struggles in recent times, Rohit's unavailability for the first Test and Shubman Gill being ruled out due to a fractured thumb, Head said the visitors will field a strong team. ""If you look at our history, you would not rule out any Indian team,"" he said. ""In the last two trips, they've had injuries and doubts, and people questioned them, but they pulled off incredible performances. Whoever they play, it's going to be a strong team,"" he added.

"Centre to deploy 5,000 personnel to Manipur as Amit Shah reviews situation; CM to meet MLAs","Advertisement The Centre has decided to send an additional 50 CAPF companies comprising more than 5,000 personnel to Manipur in view of the ""challenging"" security and law and order situation in the northeastern state, official sources said on Monday. This comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) rushed 20 additional CAPF companies, 15 from the CRPF and five from the BSF, to the state following an order issued on November 12 after violence broke out in Jiribam district and spread to other places. An additional 50 companies have been ordered to be rushed to Manipur by this week. While 35 units will be drawn from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the rest will be from the Border Security Force (BSF), the sources told PTI. CRPF Director General (CRPF) A D Singh and senior officers from other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) are also present in the state. The central government had reimposed the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in six police station areas of Manipur, including the violence-affected Jiribam, on Thursday. With last week's deployment, a total of 218 CAPF companies are now present in the state, which has been reeling from ethnic strife since May last year. A deployment plan is being drawn to base these new 50 units in Manipur as per the violence levels being reported and the dynamic law and order situation in consultation with the state government and the MHA, the sources said. Given the prevailing volatile situation, the state government ordered the closure of all educational institutions on Monday and Tuesday in Imphal East, Imphal West and Bishnupur districts where curfew has remained in force. Internet and mobile data services have also remained suspended in seven affected districts. Last week six individuals—three women and three children—were abducted and murdered by suspected Kuki insurgents in Jiribam district. The victims’ bodies were discovered five days later in neighbouring Assam, sparking protests and clashes between demonstrators and state forces. One protester, a 21-year-old, was fatally shot during these confrontations. Protesters allege that the police commandos fired the fatal shot, but the details remain unclear. Recently ten suspected Kuki militants were killed during a gunfight with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Kuki groups later surrounded a hospital where the bodies were stored, demanding they not be moved and claiming the deceased were ""village volunteers."" Additionally, the homes of several lawmakers, including Manipur Health Minister Sapam Ranjan and a BJP MLA, were targeted by violent mobs. The state government has handed over three major cases to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), including the murder of a tribal woman, an attack on a CRPF post, and incidents of arson and killings in Jiribam. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday reviewed the prevailing security situation and deployment of troops in the state for the second consecutive day and directed top officials to focus on restoring peace and order there as early as possible, sources said. The home minister reviewed the security situation of Manipur with top officials of the central and state governments, the sources said. He also took stock of the deployment of central forces there and directed the officials to restore peace and order there as early as possible, they said. This was the second consecutive day that Shah reviewed the situation of Manipur. Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh has convened a meeting with all non-Congress MLAs on Monday at 6 pm to discuss the ongoing law and order situation in the state. According to a BJP MLA, all MLAs, except the five from Congress, have been invited. The 10 Kuki-Zo legislators, including seven BJP members who left the Imphal valley due to ethnic violence, are expected to skip the meeting. Additionally, the NPP has withdrawn its support to the BJP-led government, meaning its MLAs will not attend. The state government has handed over three key cases to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). These include the killing of a tribal woman by armed militants on November 8, the attack on a CRPF post, and the arson and killings in Jiribam on November 11. Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) expressed deep concern over the unresolved ethnic conflict, which has been ongoing for 19 months. The RSS condemned the killings of women and children and urged both the central and state governments to work towards resolving the conflict at the earliest. The Congress has called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the state before the Parliament session and demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah for the failure of the ""double engine government"" there. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Modi should first meet an all-party delegation from Manipur and then hold a national-level meeting. He also criticized the Prime Minister for not visiting the state despite the ongoing crisis since May 2023, demanding action before the Parliament session begins on November 2.

"Congress asks PM Modi to visit Manipur, demands Amit Shah's resignation","Advertisement NEW DELHI: Amid spike in violence in Manipur, the Congress on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit the troubled state before the Parliament session this month and demanded Home Minister Amit Shah's resignation for the ""double engine government's complete failure"" there. Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said Modi must first meet an all-party delegation from Manipur and then also call an all-party meeting at the national level ahead of the Parliament session starting November 25. Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters here along with Manipur Congress chief K Meghachandra Singh and AICC in-charge of state Girish Chodankar, Ramesh demanded that Shah and Chief Minister N Biren Singh must resign. ""From May 3, 2023, Manipur is burning and Prime Minister Modi visits various countries of the world, gives sermons, but could not find time to visit Manipur. So, our first demand is that PM should take time out before the Parliament session to visit Manipur and meet political parties, politicians, civil society groups, and people in relief camps there,"" Ramesh said. He said the Congress also demands that the prime minister should meet an all-party delegation from Manipur and then also call an all-party meeting be called at the national level. ""From July 31, 2024, there is no full-time governor. Before that an ST person was governor but she was removed within 18 months. We demand that immediately a full-time governor be appointed,"" Ramesh said. The Congress also alleged that the prime minister has ""outsourced"" Manipur to the home minister. ""There is a strange 'jugalbandi' between the home minister and the failed CM. Why the home minister has not taken cognizance of the CM's failures and why has he been attempting to save him?"" Ramesh said. If the BJP government, the prime minister and the home minister honestly want to fight the drug mafia then why do they not act on the cases pending before the courts, he said, adding the immediate need was for the PM to visit Manipur. ""The pain of Manipur is the pain of the country. More than 300 people have died and over 60,000 have been displaced. It is a story of the complete failure of the double engine government,"" Ramesh said. The BJP got 32 out of 60 seats in the 2022 polls but within 15 months Manipur began to burn, he said. ""The double engine government has failed and has been derailed. The Home Minister is directly responsible. We want the Home Minister to resign because it is his responsibility,"" he said. Manipur Congress chief K Meghachandra Singh alleged that there is an unprecedented turmoil and ""complete anarchy"" prevailing under the double engine government. He alleged that there is no law and order at all. It is really very painful what the entire people of Manipur have to endure. Abductions of innocent people and killing of innocent people, particularly women and children, is very unfortunate, he said. ""We can recall the statement of Narendra Modi ji in February 2017 when he said in an election campaign, those who cannot ensure peace in Manipur, have no right to govern the state. I want to ask the PM is the double engine government maintaining law and order,"" he said. He said Manipur is a state in the unit of India and asked why Modi is ""neglecting"" Manipur which is becoming a forgotten state by this ""Modi regime"". ""He (PM) never speaks on Manipur. There is a total failure of law and order."" ""The CM has no right to continue. I want to urge the PM to immediately visit Manipur and give an appointment to Manipur leaders, including BJP ministers and Congress leaders,"" Meghachandra said. He said gross violations of human rights have happened in Manipur. Chodankar said violence is the tragic byproduct of the rule of the double engine government. ""The state has become headless; there is no leader who can take out the state from this violence and unrest,"" he said. Chodankar said frustration is leading to abduction and violence. It is an indication of the failure of the double engine government and also a humanitarian crisis prevailing there, he said. ""This is a complete failure of the PM and CM. The prime minister did not find a single day to visit the state. ""The Congress tried its best to restore peace. Rahul Gandhi visited Manipur thrice and our president Mallikarjun Kharge ji also visited, our whole leadership kept on raising the issue to contribute to bringing peace in Manipur,"" Chodankar said. The prime minister should engage directly with Manipur's people to curb further destruction and violence, restoring peace, he said. Violence has continued to rock the state as offices of the Congress and the BJP have been ransacked in the hill district of Jiribam where an unidentified body was found earlier. The incidents occurred after irate mobs set fire to the residences of three BJP legislators, one of whom is a senior minister, and a Congress MLA in various districts of Imphal Valley where an indefinite curfew has been clamped. Security forces also foiled the attempt of the agitators to storm the ancestral residence of the Manipur chief minister on Saturday evening. The Congress has been attacking the prime minister for not visiting Manipur, besides slamming the Centre for its handling of the situation in the ethnic strife-torn northeastern state. More than 220 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in ethnic violence between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and adjoining hills-based Kuki-Zo groups since May last year.

Nayanthara Breaks Silence On Past Relationships In Beyond The Fairytale: 'I Was Told To Quit Cinema',"In Netflix’s documentary Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairytale, the celebrated actress opens up like never before, shedding light on the challenges and transformations that have defined her life. Known for fiercely guarding her privacy, Nayanthara shares candid reflections on her past relationships, the personal struggles she endured, and how they shaped her professional journey. “My first relationship was purely based on trust, the trust that the other person is in love with you,"" she reveals. This appears to reference her high-profile relationship with actor-filmmaker Silambarasan TR during the making of his directorial debut Vallavan. Once celebrated as a power couple, their relationship ended abruptly amidst controversies, including the unauthorized leak of a private image. Nagarjuna, who was filming Boss with Nayanthara at the time, recalls how the breakup affected her. “It was a turbulent time in her relationship. In fact, we would dread the moment her phone rang because it would turn her off immediately. She became a different person,"" he shares. After the split, Nayanthara poured herself into work, taking on multiple film projects to cope. However, during her collaboration with Prabhu Deva on Villu, she found herself in another highly publicized relationship. She reveals, “It was the man who told me to quit cinema,"" highlighting the immense personal and professional sacrifices she considered for love. Their relationship faced intense public scrutiny, particularly due to Prabhu Deva’s unresolved marital issues. His then-wife Latha’s refusal to grant a divorce added pressure, and the couple eventually parted ways. Despite this turmoil, Nayanthara persevered, delivering one of her most acclaimed performances in Sri Rama Rajyam, for which she won her first Nandi Award. Reflecting on the societal double standards she faced, she remarks, “Just because I never openly addressed my past, people started writing their own stories. They started assuming the worst. How come none of the boys were asked anything?""    LATEST BLOGS"

She mentioned that during the making of her Netflix documentary, she had asked for permission from Dhanush to use visuals from their 2015 movie Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. However, Dhanush refused to grant her permission and instead sent her a legal notice, demanding Rs 10 crore in damages. “This is an all-time low from you and speaks so much about your character. I wish you were half the person you portray to be on stage in audio launches in front of your innocent fans but clearly you do not practice what you preach, at least not for me and my partner,"" a part of her post read. Later, Nayanthara’s husband Vignesh Shivan, who is the director of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, also came out in support of the Lady Superstar. He shared the controversial BTS clip on his Instagram story and mocked Dhanush’s legal notice. “The 10 crores clip that wants to be taken down from our Netflix Documentary.

India's Injury Scares Before Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Players Who Missed Out And To Miss First Test,"Team India is leaving no stone unturned to prepare for the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2025, starting next week in Perth. The players are sweating it out in the nets and playing intra-squad simulation matches to acclimatise to the Australian conditions before heading into the first Test. But at the same time, injury scares seem to be plaguing the Indian camp. The visitors have already missed out on the likes of Shami and Kuldeep Yadav due to injuries, while the fresh cases are only adding to India’s woes. With captain Rohit Sharma also opting out of the first Test following the birth of his second child, India look to be in a dire situation where finding the proper balance could be challenging. Let’s have a look at India’s injury concerns ahead of the BGT and also at those who are missing at least one Test. Rohit Sharma: The Indian captain became a father for the second time on Friday. He has been blessed with a baby boy and has decided to spend some time with his family. It has been learned that the BCCI has accepted his request. Rohit is expected to be ready for the second Test at Adelaide Oval on December 6. Shubman Gill: The dashing batter has reportedly fractured his finger and will be missing the first Test in Perth. According to reports, Gill got hurt while fielding on the second day of the intra-squad match simulation. He was seen in considerable pain and immediately left the field for further scans, which revealed a fracture in his left thumb. KL Rahul: The Karnataka batter suffered an injury scare during the visitors’ intra-squad match. He copped a blow to his right elbow from a rising ball from Prasidh Krishna and went off the field. However, it has been learned that the right-hand batter has resumed training in the nets. The exact nature of his injury and his current status are yet to be known.   LATEST BLOGS"
Seeking justice in times of regression,"Advertisement CHENNAI: More than two decades ago, a Maharashtrian woman died by suicide a little over four months after she was married. When you type a sentence like that out, it occurs to you how commonplace something like this is in the broader story of Indian womanhood. Death by purported kitchen accident or death by suicide in the first few years after marriage is not particularly shocking in this context, although it should be, and if one does not linger on that sentence, it would simply be a single pixel in a larger picture. When that particular woman died in 2002, however, her family of origin pressed charges. Her husband and in-laws were convicted in 2004 under Indian Penal Codes Sections 498A (cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband or his relatives) and 306 (abetment to suicide). But this October, a single-judge Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court gave them an acquittal. In the brief months of her marriage, some of the experiences that the deceased woman was subjected to included: being taunted for her cooking skills, being made to sleep on a carpet, not being permitted to do activities during which she may interact with other people on her own (such as leaving the house to throw garbage, visiting the temple or talking to neighbours) and not being allowed to watch TV. According to her in-laws, the suicide took place two months after her last visit to their village, Varangaon. In the acquittal order, Justice Abhay S. Waghwase stated that “…none of the allegations has any severity or such nature of allegations would not constitute physical and mental cruelty as almost allegations are pertaining to domestic affairs of the house of accused. (sic)” The order also said that, “There is no evidence to show that at that relevant point or any proximity to the suicide, there was any demand, cruelty or mal-treatment so as to connect them with the suicidal death. What triggered the suicide has remained a mystery.” What a trial court understood twenty years ago — that curtailing a person’s freedom in a hundred mundane ways adds up to cruelty, and that it is reasonable to connect that cruelty with a serious decline in mental well-being — has been reversed by a contemporary court. This isn’t only regressive. It is regression. If that deceased woman had been in that situation today, she may have opted for a divorce. She may have done so with the support of her loved ones. Perhaps, but not necessarily. Such hopeful scenarios have become more acceptable in India in the time since her demise. But the amount of agency required to leave an abusive household, and the quantum of internal and material resources required to execute that successfully, are frequently underestimated. There will be no justice for the deceased woman, and perhaps such a thing could only ever have been symbolic. Somewhere in this country — many somewheres — her situation is being replayed, still. For countless people, a legal precedent that dismisses quotidian, cumulative forms of harm presents a setback regarding how their plight will be considered by their families, by society and indeed in the eyes of the law.

Welcoming Mr. Shokeen to the AAP fold, Mr. Kejriwal said his joining will not only give a boost to the party in rural Delhi but also in other parts of the national capital.

Nayanthara Dhanush Row: How the Naanum Rowdy Dhaan Fallout Has Led To A Legal Battle,"Lady superstar Nayanthara has publicly called out Dhanush for suing her over the use of a BTS video from the Naanum Rowdy Dhaan sets in her upcoming documentary, Nayanthara: Beyond The Fairy Tale. In an open letter, she accused Dhanush of ignoring her request for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to include the footage in the film and levelled serious accusations at him. Let’s take a look at the controversy that has surrounded the film. After her 2011 Telugu film Sri Rama Rajyam, Nayanthara announced that she was quitting films. By then, she had faced a lot of personal issues, including intense media attention on her relationships with Silambarasan and Prabhudheva. These challenges led her to leave the industry at the peak of her career. It was director Atlee who brought her back with Raja Rani in 2013, which also marked his debut. The film became a big hit. However, her later films didn’t bring the same level of success. Nayanthara’s Career Hattrick Two years later, Nayanthara’s career took off with hits like Thani Oruvan and Maya. In 2015, she scored a hat-trick with Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, directed by Vignesh Shivan. During the shoot, rumors of a romance between Nayanthara and Vignesh started to spread, especially after intimate photos of them surfaced online. Actor Mansoor Ali Khan’s teasing remark about the couple talking to each other even in the scorching sun only added fuel to the fire, confirming their relationship. Nayanthara And Dhanush’s Fallout During Naanum Rowdy Dhaan Before Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, Nayanthara and Dhanush worked together in Yaaradi Nee Mohini, where they became great friends, and it showed in all their interviews during the film’s release. When Dhanush decided to produce Naanum Rowdy Dhaan for Vignesh Shivan, it seemed like a big opportunity for the film. But behind the scenes, there were rumours that Dhanush wasn’t too happy with his role as a producer while the film was being made in 2015.    LATEST BLOGS"

"Mumbai’s three constituencies want clean air, better homes","Updated - November 18, 2024 10:43 pm IST - MUMBAI Demolished slums seen in Jogeshwari. Photo: Special Arrangement In the three constituencies of Jogeshwari, Chandivali and Dharavi in Mumbai, the issues of obstacles around redevelopment, rising health concerns due to air pollution, illegal high-rises coexisting with slums and industrial units, long-pending rehabilitation projects, poor living condition in slums, lack of tribal welfare are major poll promises. From Jogeshwari (coming under Mumbai North-West parliamentary seat), Shiv Sena (UBT) candidate Anant Bala Nar (58), who has been a corporator for 10 years and chairperson of several BMC committees, is contesting against Shiv Sena candidate Manisha Waikar (61), who is the wife of MP Ravindra Waikar. Mr. Waikar switched from Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena to Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena just before Lok Sabha polls earlier this year. Also read | Intense battle of alliances, betrayals, and narratives ends in Maharashtra From Chandivali (Mumbai North-Central), Naseem Khan (61), a Congress candidate who has been a four-time MLA, is contesting against Shiv Sena candidate Dilip Lande (63), who has been MLA since 2014. In Dharavi (Mumbai South-Central), where a heated discussion over the multi-crore Dharavi Redevelopment Project has been in the news, Congress candidate Jyoti Gaikwad (47), who is also the sister of Mumbai Congress chief Varsha Gaikwad, is contesting against Shiv Sena candidate Rajesh Khandare (50), a social worker. Ms. Manisha Waikar said that once in power, the key concern will be to focus on slum rehabilitation projects. “It has been a long pending demand of people to live in afforadable and decent homes. MP Ravindra Waikar has taken this concern to New Delhi and demanded for affordable homes under the Prime Minister’s fund for tribals and slum dwellers.” While leaders with political background were seen campaigning with pomp and splendour in vans and sunroof cars decked up with marigold flowers with autos and motorbikes in the front and back rooting for the candidate on speakers, Independent candidate Vitthal Govind Lad, founder of Kashtakari Shetkari Sanghtana and Shramik Mukti Andolan, was walking from locality to locality interacting with people. He is contesting from Jogeshwari East Assembly seat and his party symbol “pen nib with seven rays” speaks of the concerns of people who are working with the organisation for years. “We have crowdfunded the election campaign cost and the security deposit of ₹10,000 for me to contest. All the pamphlets, posters, banners, and microphone costs. We do not have any car or big vans. We are walking and interacting with people,” said Mr. Lad, who has been a social worker for the past 41 years with a degree in Master of Social Work from Mumbai University. “We want to emphasise good quality homes for people under SRA project, access to potable water, proper sewage and drainage facilities and proper road in slums and tribal areas. This constituency has two kinds of spaces: one is an urban area where the population is more, but the geographical space is small and then Aarey Milk Colony where the space is bigger, but population is slim. If elected, we will work for the rights of tribal residents of Aarey to protect their land, their habitat and wildlife. We will restart the Aarey Dairy centre that has been shut for years.” In Chandivali, fed up with false promises by political parties, the residents here made their own manifesto. Mandeep Singh Makkar, founder of Chandivali Citizens Welfare Association said, “The reason we released a manifesto is because we do not have hopes from politicians. There are over a thousand residents who worked together to prepare the 20 points manifesto that raises key concerns of such as, the MLA should respect the public mandate and not switch political parties’ post-elections; stringent action against illegal bhattis [furnaces] and cement plants that is causing health concerns for many; affordable electricity charges.” Besides, Mr. Makkar said stop misuse of public funds to distribute freebies; effectively implement the Right to Service Act and the Right to Information Act among various government departments; include the BMC within the scope of the State government online RTI system; cap on private school fees and hospital charges; stop political encroachment on public spaces;  resolve traffic congestion, implement development plan roads;  a fully functional fire station for Chandivali and Powai among other important issues.” Residents of Dharavi’s Shatabdi Nagar locality wanted to boycott the elections but then they wish to change the government as they do not want the multi-crore redevelopment project to be carried out by business tycoon, Gautam Adani.  Roshan Shaikh, 47, said, “We want Dharavi redevelopment, but within Dharavi and not outside Dharvi. The project should be done by the government body and not by Adani who plans to throw Dharavikars out of Dharavi to strange far-off places in saltpans to dumping yards.” Shalini Sidharth Kamle, 52, said, “We are not boycotting the election because if we do not vote how else will we change this government? In the last few years, the current government has only given us stress in the name of Adani.” Published - November 18, 2024 10:36 pm IST Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2024 Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Madras HC contemplates setting up a monitoring panel to curb drug menace in T.N.,"Updated - November 18, 2024 06:46 pm IST - CHENNAI Photo for representational purpose. | Photo Credit: KARUNAKARAN M The Madras High Court is mulling over the constitution of an inter-departmental monitoring committee, comprising officials from the State government, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in order to ensure a “drugs free Tamil Nadu.” The Second Division Bench of Justices D. Krishnakumar and P.B. Balaji said a senior officer in the rank of Secretary to the Government could be appointed as the chairperson of the committee, and called for the names of the officers, who could be appointed to it, from the Centre and State governments. The Bench recorded the submission of Additional Solicitor General AR.L. Sundaresan, representing the Centre, and Additional Advocate General (AAG) J. Ravindran, representing the State government, that the names of the officials would be submitted before the court, in a sealed cover, by Thursday (November 21, 2024). The judges felt the necessity for a monitoring committee for the purpose of overseeing the performance of the Enforcement Bureau-Crime Investigation Department (EB-CID) and making necessary suggestions to the State govenrment for curtailing the sale of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The Division Bench also issued a direction to the Directors of School Education and Collegiate Education to issue a circular instructing all schools and colleges to put up notice boards clearly describing the consequences of the use and sale of ganja, opiate, cannabis, cocaine, opium, morphine, heroin, and so on. The notice boards must also list out the punishment under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, and mention the toll-free number 10581 created by the State government. Further, a complaint box must also be placed on the campus of all educational institutions, the court ordered. Directing educational authorities, legal aid services authorities, as well as Scouts and National Cadet Corps (NCC) to conduct awareness programmes, the judges ordered that educational authorities and the police must conduct periodical inspections in and around schools and colleges. Making it clear that principals as well as headmasters/headmistresses must be vigilant in curtailing substance abuse, the court directed the police and local body authorities to crack down on sale of prohibited substances within a radius of 100 m from educational institutions. The judges directed the AAG to submit by Thursday a list of items such as chocolates, biscuits, and stationery that could be permitted to be sold within a distance of 100 m from schools and colleges so that the court could issue further directions to the educational authorities in that regard. The interim orders were passed after taking note that the Prohibition Enforcement Wings in the State had booked 1,727 cases under the NDPS Act, arrested 2,262 suspects, and seized 7,236 kg of ganja; 45ml of ganja oil; two kg of hasish oil; 40,464 ganja chocolates; and 93.610 kg of other drugs in 2023. Further, 675 NDPS Act cases had been booked, 902 suspects had been arrested, and 2,720 kg of ganja; 3,458 ganja chocolates; and 7.319 kg of other drugs had been seized till September 2024. In addition, 368 vehicles used for transportation had been seized between January 2023 and September 2024. Taking note of news reports of narcotic substances being delivered even through couriers, the judges felt that the current strength of police personnel (belonging to both EB-CID and local police stations) might not be sufficient to effectively curb the menace of drugs, especially among students. Therefore, they insisted on establishing a monitoring committee to guide the police.

Borussia Dortmund’s sponsorship deal with major arms maker set for heated debate at club’s AGM,"Published : Nov 18, 2024 21:37 IST , DORTMUND - 2 MINS READ COMMENTS FOLLOW US SHARE  FILE PHOTO - A dummy tank stands next to an activist wearing a mask with the likeness of Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and holding up a red card ahead of the game between Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt. | Photo Credit: AP Borussia Dortmund’s sponsorship deal with an arms maker profiting from wars in Ukraine and elsewhere looks set to be a major topic for discussion at the club’s AGM on Sunday. The Schwatzgelb Dortmund fanzine has published a motion from fan Wilfried Harthan on behalf of the Heinrich Czerkus supporters’ group calling on the club to terminate the deal with Rheinmetall “as soon as possible”, and that it should not be extended beyond the end of its term in 2026 “under any circumstances.” Rheinmetall is the world’s largest maker of artillery ammunition and expects to make record group sales of around 10 billion euros ($10.6 billion) this year. Trade has been helped by conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere. Schwatzgelb says on its website that the three-year collaboration with Rheinmetall announced by the club last May was a huge surprise for most fans, coming three days before their team lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. The deal “has since shaped the club’s external image. For many Schwatzgelbe (Dortmund fans), it calls their identification as members of Borussia Dortmund into question,” Schwatzgelb said. Many Dortmund fans already showed their opposition to the deal with protests around and during the team’s first Bundesliga game of the season in August.

Founded in 1889 as “Rheinische Metallwaaren- und Maschinenfabrik Actiengesellschaft,” the Düsseldorf-based company was one of Germany’s biggest armaments manufacturers during both World Wars. It made use of forced labor during World War II. COMMENTS Borussia Dortmund / Bundesliga 2024-25 / Bundesliga / Real Madrid BACK TO TOP"
YSRCP rebuts govt.’s claims on dotted lands and Srivani Trust,"Updated - November 18, 2024 09:22 pm IST - VIJAYAWADA The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) has found fault with the State government for its remarks on dotted lands, and the proposed renaming of TTD’s Srivani Trust, and the alleged harassment of its party workers and social media activists. Addressing a press conference at the YSRCP office at Tadepalli on Monday, Yerragondapalem MLA and YSRCP leader Tatiparthi Chandrasekhar said the government’s allegations that insider trading had taken place with regard to the registration of dotted lands were uncalled for. “The lands were in possession of Dalits and weaker sections for the past two decades. If they are given land rights, what is wrong? YSRCP president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted to empower Dalits, while Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s coalition government wants to alienate them of their land rights. Insider trading was rampant in Amaravati lands I dare the government to reveal the names of the actual owners,” Mr. Chandrasekhar said. Referring to the Srivani Trust, the MLA said that it was created to collect donations from people willing to donate, and to spread religious activities and building temples across the country and in Dalit-inhabited areas. “No government had thought of giving land for cremation grounds to Dalits, something which our government had done,” he said. Stating that the police were harassing social media activists and foisting false cases on their cadre, he said that a case was registered against him and he was served a notice. “When my lawyer went to the police station, they were not cooperative. While they have been filing cases indiscriminately, our complaints are not being registered,” he added.

Rohman admitted to being a long-time admirer of Sushmita even before they met. Speaking to Zoom, he shared, “When I met her, I realized she is even more amazing than what is shown. I was a fan, but now I am a ‘pyaar wala’ fan. I saw the hard work she puts in. I am the biggest fan of her mind. She knows what is going on around her. We are still friends because I look up to her. I want to learn all of this from her. People talk about exes being friends, but if you don’t have anything common to talk about, how can you be friends?"" On their current equation, Rohman described their relationship as easygoing and natural. “We are dal-chawal, there’s a comfort, we understand each other completely, and we don’t care what people think or talk about.

That’s not all. Adding to the intrigue, Chum also admitted to having feelings for Karan, later in the episode. It all began during a task wherein contestants were asked to read out statements made about them by other housemates. Following this, they also had to guess the names of the contestants who would have said the same. Karan Veer Mehra read a statement wherein he was called ‘non-deserving’ for Chum.

King Charles protest: Australian Senate censures Indigenous member,"Updated - November 18, 2024 11:33 am IST - SYDNEY Australian politician, Senator Lidia Thorpe heckles King Charles III during the ceremonial welcome and Parliamentary reception at the Australian Parliament House on October 21, 2024, in Canberra, Australia. File | Photo Credit: Getty Images Australia's Senate on Monday (November 18, 2024) censured an Indigenous woman parliamentarian over her protest against King Charles during his visit to the parliament last month when she accused the British monarch of genocide. Independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles' sovereignty over Australia moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his ""respects to the traditional owners of the lands"". Both the ruling Labor party and the opposition coalition supported the censure motion, which will not have any legal or constitutional consequences and is only considered a symbolic move by lawmakers when they disagree on a member's conduct. Ms. Thorpe's protest was disruptive and she did not respect the democratic institutions, the motion said. The British monarch is Australia's head of state. Ms. Thorpe, a DjabWurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman, called the members who supported the motion ""hypocrites"" and said the censure process was a ploy to divert attention away from the real issues affecting Australia. ""I'll do it again, and I'll do it every time,"" Ms. Thorpe shouted in parliament when Simon Birmingham, the opposition leader in the Senate, was making his comments on the motion. ""They want me to kneel, to be silent, to disappear, but let me be clear... my loyalty lies with my people, with justice, not with a government or a crown that has systematically worked to erase us,"" Ms. Thorpe said. Ms. Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over Britain's colonisation of Australia, had to retake her oath of office in 2022 after she tweaked it to label Queen Elizabeth a coloniser. She was told to recite the affirmation — a form of parliamentary oath that omits a reference to God — as written. Australia has struggled for decades to reconcile with its Indigenous citizens, who make up 3.8% of the country's 27 million population, and are, by most socio-economic measures, the most disadvantaged people in the country. Their ancestors arrived on the continent some 50,000 years before British colonists yet were marginalised during colonial rule and are not mentioned in Australia's 123-year-old constitution. The Senate also passed a censure motion against United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet for offensive comments on social media platform X after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President.

Tamil Nadu govt. does not mechanically approve preventive detention orders: State Public Prosecutor,"Published - November 18, 2024 10:30 pm IST - CHENNAI The Tamil Nadu government does not mechanically approve all preventive detention orders passed by Collectors and Commissioners of Police. In the recent times, the Home Secretary has refused to approve at least four such orders, State Public Prosecutor (SPP) Hasan Mohamed Jinnah told the Madras High Court on Monday. The submission was made before a Division Bench of Justices R. Suresh Kumar and K.K. Ramakrishnan. The judges were hearing a petition filed by the Home Secretary seeking clarification with respect to just one of the many directions issued by them on June 30, 2023 regarding filing of counter affidavits before the court. Last year, the Bench had made it mandatory for the Home Department to file counter affidavits whenever habeas corpus petitions were filed in the High Court challenging the preventive detention orders. It had also listed out the aspects which should be addressed by the government in such counter affidavits. Making it clear that the government had absolutely no issues with filing such counter affidavits, the SPP said, aspects related to subjective satisfaction arrived at before passing the detention order and the imminent threat to public order could be addressed only by the detaining authority and not the Home Department. It was also brought to the notice of the court that a preventive detention order, passed either by a Collector or a Commissioner of Police, under the Goondas Act, would be valid only for 12 days, unless it gets approved by the State government, after finding sufficient justification for invoking the preventive detention law. Accepting his request, the Division Bench clarified that henceforth, the detaining authorities could also file counter affidavits explaining their stand with respect to subjective satisfaction and imminent threat to public order failing which the Home Department should deal with these aspects too in its counter affidavit.

National People’s Party withdraws support to Manipur government The National People’s Party (NPP) has withdrawn support to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Manipur.In a letter to BJP president J.P. Nadda on Sunday (November 17, 2024), the NPP’s national president and Meghalaya Chief Minister, Conrad K. Sangma, said his party felt the Manipur government under Nongthombam Biren Singh “completely failed” to resolve the crisis and restore normalcy in the State. “The Congress party delivers on its promises, unlike the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), which indulges in nothing more than sloganeering,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, general secretary, All India Congress Committee (AICC), said at a rally in GadchirolI. “Whatever we utter are truths. Work starts immediately after we form the government. The BJP thinks sloganeering is enough and no work needs to be done,” Ms. Gandhi said. A Delhi court has granted exemption from personal appearance to Vikash Yadav, accused of attempting to kill alleged Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the U.S., in a case of kidnapping and extortion lodged against him after he claimed threat to life. The judge directed him to appear before the court on February 3, the next date of hearing. He was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police in December last year following a complaint by a Delhi-based businessman, accusing him of extorting and kidnapping. A charge sheet was filed in March and Mr. Yadav was granted bail in April.

The arrival of new Jordan Ambassador Yousef Mustafa Ali Abdelghani and new Egyptian Ambassador Kamel Galal is viewed in the diplomatic circle as important, as both Jordan and Egypt are ‘frontline states’ that have a lot at stake in the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. Gaza's civil defence agency said 30 people were killed, including children, and dozens were missing after an Israeli airstrike hit a building in the Palestinian territory's north.

NITI Aayog's MMR blueprint a ploy to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra: Uddhav,"Published - November 18, 2024 11:24 am IST - Mumbai Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray during a public meeting ahead of Maharashtra Assembly elections at BKC, Mumbai on Sunday (November 17, 2024). | Photo Credit: PTI Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday (November 17, 2024) alleged that the NITI Aayog’s blueprint to develop the metropolitan region was a ploy to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra by undermining the BMC’s importance. “If voted to power, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) will scrap the MoU signed between the World Economic Forum (WEF) and MMRDA as it is aimed at diminishing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s importance,” he said. Addressing a rally at the BKC ground in Mumbai on the penultimate day before the campaigning for the assembly elections concluded, Mr. Thackeray said he wouldn’t hesitate to disband the MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) if it encroaches on the BMC’s jurisdiction. “A conspiracy to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra is not just a loose talk but an impending serious crisis. The ploy is real, but we will never allow this to happen,” he said. Mr. Thackeray said the MMRDA and WEF signed an agreement in September to develop MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) as a global economic hub which was signed after Niti Aayog’s report on MMR development. “The Niti Aayog’s blueprint diminishes the importance of the Mumbai civic body which is a ploy to separate Mumbai from Maharashtra,” he alleged. Mr. Thackeray said the first decision of the MVA government will be to scrap policies of the (Mahayuti) government which handed over Mumbai’s land to the Adani group. The former chief minister said he was “not anti-development but is anti-destruction”. Mr. Thackeray claimed the MVA government headed by him was toppled (in June 2022) and Shiv Sena split because he had not allowed the looting of Maharashtra. In an apparent reference to the Shiv Sena MLAs’ disqualification case in the Supreme Court, saying, “The courts haven’t given me justice. I seek justice from you for the sake of Maharashtra”. Mr. Thackeray said the BJP had to construct the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had banned RSS, in Gujarat and seek votes in Maharashtra in Balasaheb Thackeray’s name, which he said was “revenge of time”. Attacking PM Narendra Modi over the “Ek hai to Safe Hai” slogan, Mr. Thackeray said if people feel unsafe while PM Modi is at the helm then he should resign. “Only corrupt and traitors feel safe when Modi is around,” he alleged. Mr. Thackeray said Maharashtra was facing a grave crisis as “airports, ports, electricity, mines, and schools are being handed over to Adani”. Urging people to support the MVA, Mr. Thackeray said Maharashtra will be destroyed if the Mahayuti returns to power. Mr. Thackeray recalled Shiv Sena’s support for the abrogation of Article 370 and Bal Thackeray sheltering Kashmiri pandits fleeing persecution. “Amit Shah and Narendra Modi weren’t known to the world at that time,” he said. Targeting the BJP over its poll campaign, he said the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir doesn’t impact Minimum Support Price, unemployment, and women’s security in Maharashtra. He said people of Gujarat should realise that PM Modi and Amit Shah have created a barrier between the western state and the rest of the country. “How can they move projects from Maharashtra to Gujarat? You should stop them,” he added. Published - November 18, 2024 11:24 am IST Mumbai / Maharashtra / development Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Manipur violence: NIA registers three FIRs to probe fresh incidents of violence,"Updated - November 18, 2024 03:33 pm IST - New Delhi The cases taken over by the NIA are those related to the murder of a woman at Jiribam by fully armed militants” (FIR registered at Jiribam local police on November 8). | Photo Credit: V. Sudershan The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered three cases in connection with the latest instances of violence in the strife-torn Manipur, according to official sources. The cases, which were originally filed by Manipur Police, were registered by the anti-terror agency on November 13 and the investigation into these cases has begun, the sources said on Monday (November 18, 2024). The cases taken over by the NIA are those related to the ""murder of a woman at Jiribam by fully armed militants"" (FIR registered at Jiribam local police on November 8), ""attack on a CRPF post located at Jakuradhor Karong and Borobekra police stations, Jiribam by armed militants"" (FIR registered at Borobekra police station on November 11) and ""burning of houses and killing of civilian at Borobekra"" (FIR registered at Borobekra police station on November 11), they said. Manipur’s Jiribam violence: Protester killed in firing during clash with security forces The situation in Manipur, which has been reeling from ethnic strife since May last year, has been volatile following protests and violence after the recovery of bodies of women and children. Irate mobs set fire to the residences of three more BJP legislators, one of whom is a senior minister, and a Congress MLA in various districts of Imphal Valley on Saturday night even as security forces foiled an attempt by agitators to storm the ancestral residence of Chief Minister N Biren Singh. On November 11, Manipur Police said 10 suspected militants were killed in a fierce gunfight with security forces after insurgents in camouflage uniforms and armed with sophisticated weapons fired indiscriminately at Borobekra police station and an adjacent CRPF camp at Jakuradhor in Jiribam. Hours later, suspected militants allegedly abducted six civilians, including women and children from the same district, according to police. On Saturday, the Union home ministry said all security forces deployed in Manipur have been directed to take necessary steps to restore order and peace in the state. More than 220 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in ethnic violence between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and adjoining hills-based Kuki-Zo groups since May 2023. It started after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. The ethnically diverse Jiribam, which was largely untouched by the clashes, witnessed violence after the mutilated body of a farmer was found in a field in June this year.

"From Overtalking To PDA, 5 Mistakes To Avoid While Meeting Your In-Laws For The First Time","The Indian matrimonial system is not just about the bride and the groom but involves winning the approval of your in-laws. Meeting your in-laws for the first time is a crucial part of your wedding journey, and may determine your relationship with them. It can also impact your dynamics with your partner. Gestures and conversation in the meeting can make or break your first impression with your in-laws. If you’re about to meet your in-laws for the first time, we have prepared a list of list of 5 mistakes you must avoid while meeting your in-laws for the first time: During a recent appearance on the Great Indian Kapil Show, philanthropist and author Sudha Murty shared a sneak peek into her love story with Infosys founder Narayana Murty. She said her father, a college professor got a bad first impression of her husband as he was two hours late while meeting him for the first time. This highlighted the fact that being late can ruin your chances of making a first good impression with your partner’s parents. Many elderly people are particular about time and may consider you irresponsible if you get late on the first meet. If you tend to talk more than you listen and end up talking too much about yourself, your in-laws are bound to reject you as a snob. It is important to present yourself as a humble person who is genuinely interested in keeping their ward happy and safe. You can ask a few questions about your in-law’s likes and choices, which might work in your favour. While the modern world allows free expression of love, public displays of affection in front of Indian parents are a big no! If you tend to engage in it, it would present you as disrespectful and ill-mannered. Make sure to maintain a distance from your partner in front of your in-laws.    LATEST BLOGS"
Ponguleti criticises BRS leaders for spreading ‘falsehoods’ on caste survey,"Published - November 18, 2024 07:05 pm IST - HYDERABAD Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy Criticising the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) leaders for spreading ‘falsehoods’ on the ongoing comprehensive household survey, Revenue Minister Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy has asserted that the survey has been launched with the intention of identifying problems at the grassroots level and ensuring that benefits of the government schemes reach the last mile. He said no one would forego any benefits due to them because of the survey and asked them not to trust the Goebel’s propaganda of the opposition parties. The government was prepared to take constructive suggestions from the opposition but these parties were trying to politicise the survey which was launched for larger public good. Mr. Srinivas Reddy said the survey was taken up to prepare a database of the standards of living of different sections so that the government could plan for more effective delivery of its services to the people. The entire information would be computerised once the ongoing survey that would be a model for other States to follow was completed by this month-end. He launched a trenchant attack on BRS leaders for spreading false propaganda that the survey was aimed at snatching away benefits from deserving sections. “These allegations indicate their apprehensions about political survival once the government prepares the database and extends schemes to people,” he said. Mr. Srinivas Reddy recalled the similar Samagra Kutumba Survey taken up in the initial years of the BRS and wondered why the then government kept the findings of the survey under wraps. “Leave alone the common man, we in the government are unable to trace the data prepared during the survey,” he said. He alleged that the previous government had deliberately kept the data out of public domain as the main intention behind the exercise was to ‘loot available resources’. Advising opposition parties against politicising the survey, he exhorted people to register their details so that schemes befitting all sections could be launched in the coming days. He appreciated BRS leader Kalvakuntla Kavita for participating in the survey and registering her details and asked the other BRS leaders too to emulate her. He advised the BRS leaders to realise the mistakes committed during the party’s rule rather than misleading the people.

"Beware Of This QR Code Scam, You Might Be Paying A Fraudster Instead Of A Shopkeeper","A shocking incident involving QR code fraud has emerged from a kachori (fried dumpling) shop in Agra. The scam, which targeted both the shopkeeper and customers, involved the misuse of the digital payment system. The perpetrators cleverly superimposed a fake QR code over the legitimate one displayed in the shop. The fraud came to light when, despite customers making payments, the funds failed to appear in the shopkeeper’s account. The case was reported from a shopkeeper at a Tanga Stand (autorickshaw stand) in the Tajganj area of Agra. The perpetrators cleverly concealed the original QR code with a convincing counterfeit, preventing customers from suspecting foul play. When customers made purchases and scanned the fraudulent code, their payments were redirected to the scammer’s account instead of the shopkeeper’s. The shopkeeper only discovered the crime when he checked his account after a full day of sales and found no record of the day’s earnings. Incidents of fraud using fake QR codes are increasing in the Tajganj area. Following this case, new incidents have come to light at a dairy and a paan shop using the same method. This spate of incidents has created fear among other traders in the Tajganj area. Many shopkeepers have inspected their QR codes and demanded increased police security measures. Traders have expressed concern that if such incidents continue, customers’ trust in digital payments may be eroded. LATEST BLOGS"

Farmers’ body seeks Directorate of Municipal Administration‘s intervention to stop dumping of garbage around quarries near Tiruppur,"Published - November 18, 2024 11:45 pm IST - TIRUPPUR Tonnes of garbage have been dumped around one of the abandoned mines at Pongupalayam panchayat near Tiruppur city. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement The Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Protection Association has urged the Directorate of Municipal Administration to prevail upon the Tiruppur Corporation to desist from dumping garbage around abandoned quarries in Pongupalayam panchayat near Tiruppur city. The dumping of garbage must be halted immediately to protect farmlands and ensure environmental sustainability, R. Sathish Kumar, State Secretary (Legal Awareness Wing), Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Protection Association said in a petition, copies of which were also addressed to the Chairman, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board; District Collector, Tiruppur; Commissioner, Tiruppur Corporation; District Environment Engineer, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board; and Assistant Director, Department of Geology and Mines, Collectorate, Tiruppur. Tiruppur Corporation’s renewed waste dumping in Pongupalayam quarry was causing a grave concern, threatening not only the environment but also the livelihoods of local farmers and households. It is a direct violation of environmental laws, judicial directives, and India’s cultural heritage, Mr. Satishkumar said. Citing the rulings of National Green Tribunal (NGT), the petition said unregulated waste dumping in abandoned quarries caused environmental and health risks. Mr. Satishkumar cited the instance of NGT penalising the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for dumping mixed waste in abandoned quarry pits in Bagalur, Bengaluru. This act violated the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and resulted in fines and directives for bio-mining and scientific waste disposal. The tribunal found BBMP’s actions endangered public health and polluted groundwater, underlining the need for environmental clearances and compliance with legal frameworks. The waste dumping was being carried out in abandoned quarry lands with these survey numbers: 199, 206 (poramboke land), 209 in Kalampalayam, Pongupalayam village, Tiruppur North Taluk. Tiruppur, he said. The act of Corporation officials permitting waste dumping in the quarry was tantamount to abuse of power. Such a practice violates the constitutional rights of citizens (Article 21) and attracts provisions under BNS 198, which penalises the misuse of authority to the detriment of public welfare. Pongupalayam Panchayat struggles to meet the water demands of its residents. The local community depends heavily on groundwater through borewells for their daily needs. Waste dumping and potential contamination of groundwater will exacerbate this crisis, making clean drinking water inaccessible. Also, the 8th-century Thirumuruganatha Swamy Temple, located in the Thirumurugan Poondi municipality near the quarry, is a significant cultural and spiritual site. The quarries in Pongupalayam are surrounded by agricultural lands that depend on groundwater and rainwater for irrigation. Dumping untreated municipal and industrial waste, including hazardous foundry waste, will severely impact soil quality, water resources, and crop productivity, jeopardizing the livelihoods of local farmers. The pollutants from untreated waste and foundry waste threaten to infiltrate groundwater, leading to severe health risks, including cancer, skin diseases, respiratory and gastrointestinal Issues.

Nigeria's Population And Economic Role: Key Highlights Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on his first official visit to Nigeria at the invitation of President Ahmed Tinubu. This visit highlights the deep and historic ties between India and Nigeria, a relationship that dates back to India’s support for African nations’ independence movements following its independence in 1947. India established its embassy in Nigeria in 1958, two years before Nigeria attained independence in 1960. First Indian PM to Visit Nigeria India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Nigeria in September 1962, shortly after the country gained independence. His visit laid the foundation for strong diplomatic relations. Four decades later, in 2002, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee travelled to Nigeria to participate in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This was followed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit in 2007, further strengthening bilateral ties. Now, in 2024, PM Narendra Modi’s visit marks another milestone in this enduring partnership. Nigeria’s Population vs Uttar Pradesh Nigeria, the most populous democracy in Africa, has a population that is surprisingly smaller than the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. According to the Worldometer database, Nigeria’s population in 2024 is estimated to be approximately 234.5 million, whereas Uttar Pradesh’s population is projected to be around 257 million, as per the World Population Review. Despite this current difference, Nigeria’s population is growing rapidly. The United Nations estimates that by 2050, Nigeria’s population could reach a staggering 400 million, making it one of the fastest-growing countries globally.      LATEST BLOGS"
Manipur Gunfight To Abductions And Killings: NIA Takes Over 3 Jiribam Cases,"Amid the ongoing tension in Manipur, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken over the probe into three cases related to Jiribam violence from the state police.

History of the ancient Pallava capital,"Advertisement I bought myself a Kamakshi Deepam last week after years of wanting one. This naturally led to thoughts of the Devi at Kanchipuram, and I remembered a nice story from the holy city’s annals. Sometime in the 1960s, a poor bangle-seller wandered from place to place, selling his wares. One day, he wandered into the temple town of Kanchipuram. Somehow, nobody seemed interested in buying anything. Tired and dejected by late afternoon, he sat down at the doorway of the Kanchi Kamakoti Matham. From deep within, the Kanchi Paramacharya, renowned for his frequently amazing omniscience, suddenly told an aide, “Give the bangle-seller at the gate food and buttermilk. Ask him to wait. Quietly tell the devotees who come for evening darshan to buy bangles for their womenfolk in Devi’s honour.” Of course, they did, and the bangle-seller went away feeling cherished and successful. Not everyone may be in a position to perform great deeds of service, but good thoughts and small, sweet acts of kindness could be the lamps we light. But a little on Kanchipuram itself. As many know, it’s located about a two hours’ drive north of Chennai. But there is a larger, deeper context. As mentioned in an earlier column in this series, there are seven mokshapuri or salvation cities in India, namely Kashi or Varanasi, Avantika or Ujjain, Ayodhya, Haridwar, Mathura, Dwaraka and Kanchipuram. Out of these, Kanchipuram is the sole mokshapuri city present in South India. The present Kamakshi temple is variously attributed to the Pallavas and the Cholas, to well over a millennium ago but its site and structure, according to literature, was even more ancient. The central image of the goddess is considered swayambhu or self-manifested and of imponderable antiquity. Kanchipuram was the capital city of the Pallavas—an audacious race of seafarers and temple builders—even though the city existed much before the Pallava dynasty came to be. The earliest known mention of Kanchipuram is by Panini, the Sanskrit grammarian, in about 300 BCE. It has even featured in numerous Tamil epics of the second century CE. Some Ashokan edicts are said to refer to the kingdom of ‘Satyaputta' or Satyaputra, besides those of the Chera, Chola and Pandya in the south. One of the several names borne by Kanchi city is ‘Satyavaratakshetra’ so Satyaputta is understood to mean Kanchipuram. The old word kanchi literally means the gold girdle worn around the waist by women. In the northern texts of the Bhagavatam, the city is given the name, Kamakoshnipuri Kanchi. In this salvation city, the Kamakshi temple is the physical hub. It is also one point of a Shakti energy-triangle encapsulated in the local prayer-phrase ‘Kanchi Kamakshi, Madurai Meenakshi, Kashi Vishalakshi’. The gopuras or towers of almost all the important temples of the city, standing far and near, reportedly face the shrine of Kamakshi. Three of the 63 Tamil Shaivite saints called Nayanmar—Tirunavukkarasar, Tirugnana-sambandar and Sundarar—have apparently referred to the Kamakottam in their devotional songs. Of them, Sambandar, has even spoken of ‘Kanchi Kamakoti’ or the locality of the Kamakshi temple. Besides its glory as a ‘mokshapuri’ or salvation city, Kanchipuram is also revered as a shakti peetham, since this where the nabhi or navel of Sati Devi is believed to have fallen. There is a count of 51 shakti peethas across the subcontinent, marking where the dismembered body parts of Sati Devi fell after her corpse was cut down from a grieving Lord Shiva’s shoulder by Lord Vishnu. The northwestern-most shakti peetham is at Hinglaj Mata in Balochistan, where Sati’s brahmarandhra or crown of her head fell, and the easternmost one is her yoni at Kamakhya Devi in Guwahati (Kamakhya means Kamakshi). So Kamakshi’s temple in Kanchipuram is the southernmost shakti peetham. Here, Parasakti, having Saraswathi and Parvathi as her eyes, rules Kanchi as goddess Kamakshi. The temple sits on an area of about five acres. The vimanam of the sanctum is gold-plated. Around the complex, one can see its sannidhis and mandapas, rich in its architectural splendour. The outer prakaram houses the temple kulam (tank), and several mandapas. It also offers imposing views of the golden vimanam, pierced with four entrances on all four sides. There is a gold-plated pillar inside the sanctum of the Kamakshi temple with a small hole in it to represent Sati Devi’s navel. Childless couples come and touch it reverently to ask for the boon of a child, and Kamakshi’s reputation of centuries is that she answers their prayers She blesses those who love her and trust her with well-being, good health and trouble-free lives, Anyone who is heartsore, weary or troubled, can go to her without needing to observe rigorous fasts or perform complicated rituals. As Adi Shankara put it in the third verse of the Bhavani Ashtakam, Na Jaanami Daanam Na Cha Dhyana-Yogam/Na Jaanami Tantram Na Cha Stotra-Mantram/Na Jaanami Pujaam Na Cha Nyasa-Yogam/Gatis-Tvam Gatis-Tvam Tvam-Ekaa Bhavani
This means, ‘Neither am I able to practise great charity, nor am I proficient in meditation, I don’t know spells, hymns and prayers, nor do I know the rules of worship nor am I an expert in yoga. You are my sole refuge, Mother Bhavani.’ Indeed a comforting, un-transactional relationship for devotees.

Speaking order by Supreme Court against bulldozer justice,"Advertisement ‘Bulldozer justice’ by the executive was troublesome at so many different levels that it was surprising how the drastic punishment was allowed to be replicated in several states for years. It militated against the basic principles of the rule of law, right to life, right to shelter, and the rights of an accused protected by the Constitution. The ultra-slow grind of the windmill of justice ended last week when the Supreme Court declared that snap demolition of homes of any accused or even a convict was unlawful without following due process. The judges announced a series of safeguards to rein in overzealous public officers who ordered instant demolition. Dwelling on the constitutional separation of powers, the court said the executive cannot go beyond its remit to become a judge, decide that an accused is guilty, and punish him by demolishing his properties. Since the executive exercises its powers as a trustee of the citizens, its actions must be consistent with maintaining public trust. Arbitrary demolition of houses of citizens only on the ground that they are accused of a crime is contrary to the principles of the rule of law. The bench called out those who failed to follow the basic principles of natural justice, saying it was reminiscent of lawlessness where might alone was right. Even convicts awarded capital punishment have the constitutional safeguard of appeal in higher courts. The right to a fair trial is essential in upholding the rule of law and protecting individual liberties. Besides, how could the family of an accused be denied their right to shelter, it questioned. The court set a 15-day notice period prior to the razing of a property so as to give the affected party time to challenge the order. Even those who do not wish to contest the order need sufficient time to vacate the premises, the verdict reasoned, adding: “Heavens would not fall on the authorities if they hold their hands for some period.” Officials who flout the SC order would be liable to pay compensation out of their pockets. That said, the directions would not be applicable if there was an unauthorised structure in a public place and also in the case of an order for demolition by a court of law. With this speaking order, one hopes bulldozer justice would end for good. Arbitrary action against the rule of law has no place in a civilised society.

"Curb insurance misselling, use bad bank for NPAs: FM to banks","Published - November 18, 2024 10:29 pm IST - MUMBAI FM Nirmala Sitharaman unveils a commemorative coin of ₹100 on the occasion of 100 years centenary of SBI Horniman circle branch in Mumbai.  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday emphasised the need to retain public confidence in India’s banking system by urging lenders to rein in mis-selling of insurance products and other activities that raise customer costs, and be more assertive about resolving distressed assets through the bad bank NARCL. “Your core business is to mobilise deposits and lend money. I wish that core is looked into again, only to pursue it further,” Ms. Sitharaman said at an SBI event, singling out banks’ distribution of insurance products as a cause of concern. “I wish to say this for due consideration of banks’ boards. While this model [bancassurance] has significantly contributed to improving insurance penetration across the country, it has also raised concerns about instances of mis-selling, and I would say, contributed in indirect ways of increased cost of borrowing for the customers,” she pointed out. “So banks will have to look at it with a lot more emphasis on their core banking activities and not burden customers with insurance which they don’t require. Banks must prioritise on transparency, ethical practices and clear communication strategies for us to earn the trust of the people,” she stressed. On the NARCL, which has acquired 18 accounts with a loan exposure of around ₹92,000 crore so far, the minister said banks can be more ambitious and the NARCL more proactive in getting this working “far more speedily”. “I will say a few things on which I would like the bank management, particularly of SBI, to pay a bit more attention. Banks need to be equipped to deal with the flow of distressed assets and the markets need to be equipped to channel investments into the reconstruction and revival of such assets. This is where the NARCL can be used,” she remarked. “The establishment of a government-backed company for the aggregation and resolution of distressed assets will further improve liquidity and competition in the market. This was my feeling when we set up the NARCL,” she said. The NARCL was formed in 2021 to clean up stressed assets in the banking system. “Banks should serve as a vital pillar of trust building with the public and trust should be built by the way you offer your portfolios, by the way you offer your service and by the way, you look at each customer’s requirement without clubbing them into one class, particularly in the context where banks facilitate the distribution of insurance products,” the minister noted. She also nudged public sector lenders to increase their small ticket lending operations, especially to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises or MSMEs. The Finance Ministry, she said, had recently cleared additional lending of ₹1.54 lakh crore on top of the current lending target of ₹4.21 lakh crore for the sector. The target for 2025-2026 is ₹6 lakh crore and the following year at ₹7 lakh crore, she added.

Manipur violence: Amit Shah reviews security situation for second day; Centre to send additional 50 CAPF companies,"Updated - November 18, 2024 06:46 pm IST - New Delhi Representational image only. File | Photo Credit: ANI Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday (November 18, 2024) reviewed the prevailing security situation and deployment of troops in Manipur for the second consecutive day and directed top officials to focus on restoring peace and order there as early as possible, sources said. The Union Home Ministry is also rushing in about 5,000 paramilitary troops to Manipur to assist the State government in handling the current “volatile” situation.

This was the second consecutive day that Mr. Shah reviewed the situation in Manipur. He took stock of the deployment of central forces there and directed the officials to restore peace and order there as early as possible, they said. “The Centre has decided to send an additional 50 CAPF companies comprising more than 5,000 personnel to Manipur in view of the “challenging” security and law and order situation in the northeastern State,” official sources said. This comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) rushed 20 additional Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) companies, 15 from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and five from the Border Security Force (BSF), to the State following an order issued on November 12 after violence broke out in Jiribam district and spread to other places. Manipur violence: Protester killed in firing during clash with security forces in Jiribam “An additional 50 companies have been ordered to be rushed to Manipur by this week. While 35 units will be drawn from the CRPF, the rest will be from the BSF,” the sources told PTI. CRPF Director General (CRPF) A.D. Singh and senior officers from other CAPF are also present in the State. With last week's deployment, a total of 218 CAPF companies are now present in the State, which has been reeling from ethnic strife since May last year. “A deployment plan is being drawn to base these new 50 units in Manipur as per the violence levels being reported and the dynamic law and order situation in consultation with the State Government and the MHA,” the sources said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah will also hold a meeting to review the security situation in Manipur on Monday (November 18, 2024) and is expected to chalk out a strategy to handle the ""volatile"" situation in the State. The situation in Manipur has been volatile following protests and violence after the recovery of bodies of women and children. NIA registers three FIRs to probe fresh incidents of violence in Manipur On Saturday (November 16, 2024), the MHA said all security forces deployed in Manipur have been directed to take necessary steps to restore order and peace in the State. It said armed miscreants from both communities in conflict have been indulging in violence, leading to unfortunate loss of lives and disruption in public order. The Home Ministry said strict action would be initiated against anyone trying to indulge in violent and disruptive activities. Seeing the fragile situation, the Centre on Thursday (November 14, 2024) reimposed the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Manipur's six police station areas, including the violence-hit Jiribam. More than 220 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in the ethnic violence between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and adjoining hills-based Kuki-Zo groups since May last year.

'Going To Play Well At Some Stage': Travis Head Remains Wary Of Virat Kohli Returning To Form,"Despite his poor returns with the bat of late, Australia’s middle-order Test batter, Travis Head remains wary of Virat Kohli’s class with the willow and reckons that he could have his moments in the gruelling five-match Test series set to begin on November 22. Head explained that the Australian side has looked at their options against each player in the Indian squad and hopes that Kohli is not able to get going much in the upcoming battle between two of the best Test nations at present. “No doubt, we will go through all their players, can’t wait to start well against them. Virat’s going to have his moments in this series, hopefully not too many of them,"" Head told the media at the Optus Stadium after Australia’s training session. The left-handed batter feels that Kohli’s dry run has to end at some point which is something the Aussies have to respect looking at his class but also hopes that the hosts have a few moments of their own which will get them the win. “He is a world-class player. Throughout five Tests, he is going to play well at some stage. We have to understand and respect that. Hopefully, the players on our side also have their moments in the series,"" said the left-handed batter. Head also emphasised Kohli’s stature within the sport and hinted that the closed training sessions could have taken some pressure off to let him play more freely in the nets. “He is pretty big. Everyone talks about Virat, wherever he goes. Maybe the closed sessions give him a bit of freedom, a bit of space,"" he said. “There won’t be a series where you would play India and you wouldn’t talk about Kohli,"" Head added.     LATEST BLOGS"
CPM blames CM Biren Singh for Manipur violence; seeks Centre's intervention,"Advertisement NEW DELHI: The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM) on Monday said that Chief Minister Biren Singh is responsible for the deteriorating situation in Manipur since the beginning. Despite the circumstances, the Central government and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to remove him and allowed him to continue, read a statement issued by the Polit Bureau of the party. Terming the situation 'grave', the CPM said that a situation has now arisen where the writ of the state government and the administration does not run. ""A grave situation has developed in Manipur with the intensification of violence due to killings and counter-killings on ethnic lines. 20 people have been killed in various incidents since November 7.

Her philosophy of smiling through life’s challenges resonated with people, inspiring those around her to embrace life’s ups and downs with grace and laughter. From being a freedom fighter during India’s struggle for independence to teaching in Kenya, Somalia, and the West Indies, she has navigated through different cultures. Even in her later years, she remained a dynamic force, acting in pantomimes at 92, starring in music videos, and becoming a beloved figure at The Little Theatre, run by her daughter, Aysha Rau. Her son-in-law, Jayraj Rau, recalls how Supriya preserved the ‘smile’ article like a treasure, diligently photocopying it to share her wisdom and optimism. He says, “She was a strong advocate for the power of a smile. No matter the situation, she believed in the simple yet profound impact of smiling. She often said, “Just smile, whatever happens.” In her own words, she beautifully expressed how a smile can alleviate so much - whether you’re feeling up or down - and how it can transform the way people interact with you.” Aysha fondly reminisces her mother’s zest for life: “She acted in Star Wars for The Little Theatre at 92, playing a senior Princess Leia, and even at 99, she travelled, sang, and engaged with everyone with unmatched energy. She truly lived every minute of her life. November 18, 1924, was the day Ma was born. She passed away just 25 days short of her 100th birthday. Nevertheless, we’re celebrating her incredible life on that day.” Supriya’s warmth extended far beyond her family. Everyone who met her remembered her for her kindness. Aysha says, “Even the meat supplier refused to charge for her birthday order, moved by her memory. She had that much of an impact. She had a way of making everyone feel seen and valued.” Aysha also recalls fond childhood memories spent in the kitchen, watching her mother cook with precision and flair. “I’d sit there, writing down the recipes she created,” she shares. Her talents weren’t confined to the kitchen. A natural performer, Supriya began singing at the tender age of three and continued to share her voice with others throughout her life. Beyond music, she immersed herself in helping others, dedicating her time to hospitals and various causes. “I don’t know how she managed it all. She had this incredible ability to give so much of herself,” says Aysha. Even in her final years, Supriya’s liveliness was undiminished. She drove the car till she was 90. In July 2024, she travelled to Dindigul to attend a wedding. Being a Bengali married to a Malayali, she embodied inclusivity, blending family traditions with a broader perspective of love and forgiveness. “She was a wonderful listener. She would absorb all your issues and respond gently with her thoughts. Her wisdom brought people together. Her ability to forgive and let go of grudges was remarkable. She didn’t just preach it; she lived it,” says Jayraj. Having lived through significant historical shifts, Supriya witnessed immense societal and technological changes. Recalling the memories of Independence Day, Supriya once said, “Then on the 15th was Independence Day, but we didn’t have all this flag hoisting. We all volunteered to go to different hospitals to help the wounded and the boys took out a peace procession and asked Hindus and Muslims not to fight each other because they were all brothers.” Supriya’s family is committed to honouring her incredible life. Plans to celebrate her legacy include revisiting her writings, sharing her stories, and possibly publishing her biography. Aysha is dedicating The Little Theatre’s Christmas Pantomime in Supriya’s memory. Asked what message she would leave for future generations, her family reflects on her unwavering belief in kindness, forgiveness, and living life to the fullest. Aysha says, “She taught us that smiles can heal, that life’s challenges should be met with grace, and that love and laughter are the greatest legacies we can leave behind.” Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp  Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest  Advertisement Copyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

Opinion | How PM Modi Has Turned Mumbai Into India’s Premier Infrastructure Gateway,"The Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), also known as Atal Setu, is a 21.8-km, six-lane expressway bridge connecting Mumbai with Navi Mumbai, its satellite city. It is the longest sea bridge in India and the 12th longest in the world. The six-lane highway is 27 metres wide, with two additional emergency exit lanes, and has the capacity to handle over 70,000 vehicles per day. Previously a 42-km drive, Atal Setu now reduces the commute between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to just 20 minutes. This monumental infrastructure project showcases India’s engineering prowess and highlights the country’s trajectory towards a ‘Viksit Bharat’ under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The MTHL was first proposed by Wilbur Smith and Associates in 1963, during Prime Minister Nehru’s tenure, and was initially conceptualised as the Uran Bridge. However, like many Nehruvian projects, it remained a lethargic paper tiger for decades, despite the Congress ruling Maharashtra for the longest time in the last six-odd decades. The Congress attempted to resurrect the MTHL project in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011 but failed each time. Between 2004 and 2011, bids were announced and later cancelled, while tenders were rejected due to political infighting between the Congress and Sharad Pawar’s party. As a result, the MTHL became a white elephant. However, between November 2015 and February 2016, the project witnessed a dramatic turnaround. All relevant state and Central approvals were obtained on a fast-track basis, and funding from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was secured, with the Modi government providing a counter-guarantee for the JICA loan. The funding agreement between JICA and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) was signed in May 2016. Following a transparent bidding process, work on the Rs 17,843 crore MTHL project began in earnest in 2018 and was completed in record time by 2023. The bridge was inaugurated in January 2024 by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself.                         LATEST BLOGS"
Ready To Deliver On Modi-Xi Common Understandings To Improve Ties: China,"China on Monday said it stands ready to deliver on important common understandings reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the recent BRICS summit leading to a thaw in the relations frozen for over four years due to military standoff at Eastern Ladakh. “Recently, President Xi Jinping met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the margins of the BRICS summit held in Kazan,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a media briefing here while responding to a question on the likelihood of a meeting the two leaders on the sidelines of G20 summit in Brazil. “China stands ready to work with India to deliver on the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and cooperation and enhance strategic mutual trust,"" he said, adding that he has no information on the specifics of the meeting of the leaders and officials. At their Kazan meeting, the two leaders endorsed the India-China agreement on patrolling and disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and issued directions to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms, signalling attempts to normalise ties that were hit by a deadly military clash in 2020. In the nearly 50-minute meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit at Kazan, Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility in border areas and that mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should remain the basis of the relations.

Kittur MLA Babasaheb Patil admitted that he got an offer when the Congress was forming the government in Karnataka. “I have several friends in the BJP. They asked me to join their party. That was based on our friendship and cordial relationship. I was not offered any money. But that was the last time (this topic was discussed). Since then, no one has approached me asking me to join the BJP,” he told reporters in Kittur. Mandya MLA Ganiga Ravi had alleged that the BJP had tried to lure Babasaheb Patil with an offer of ₹100 crore to switch parties. Raju (Bharamagouda Alagouda) Kage, Congress MLA from Kagwad and chairman of North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, denied receiving any offer, monetary or otherwise, at any time whatsoever. “I do not know why my name is doing the rounds. I do not know the context in which the CM has spoken of the attempts at engineering defection. I will go to Bengaluru on November 19 and speak to the CM and others about the issue,’‘ Mr Kage said.

Double murder: Family feud between relatives results in death,"Published - November 18, 2024 11:25 am IST - HYDERABAD An altercation between two relatives ended in a double murder late Sunday (November 17, 2024) evening in Nagilla Village, of Madgul.  According to the complaint filed by Bojja Rameshwar Reddy, a former Sarpanch and farmer, the clash occurred on Sunday evening at around 7 p.m. during a local festival at the home of Barkam Chandraiah, a relative of one of the victims. The victims, 54-year-old Barkam Yadaiah, and his 40-year-old brother-in-law, Gaddam Srinu, were involved in a heated argument that escalated into a fight. “Yadaiah, a former convict who had served eight years in Cherlapally Prison for the murder of his wife in 2014, had been living alone in the village since his release two years ago. Srinu, a centering mason from Medipally village, had come to Nagilla to attend the festival and decided to visit Yadaiah,” explained the police.  At approximately 7 p.m., the two began quarreling inside Yadaiah’s home. “The argument turned physical, with both men attacking each other with a wooden pestle and sticks. Yadaiah struck Srinu multiple times on the head and body, causing severe injuries that led to his death. During the altercation, Srinu retaliated, inflicting similar injuries on Yadaiah. Both men bled out and succumbed to their injuries at the scene,” added the police.  Villagers discovered the bodies after hearing about the incident and alerted the Madgul police at around 1 a.m. of Monday.  They booked a case and an investigation is underway to gather further evidence. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem examination.

"Colourful processions mark Kanaka Jayanti in Belagavi, Vijayapura districts","Published - November 18, 2024 07:14 pm IST - Belagavi Folk artists performing Dollu Kunita during a procession taken out on Kanaka Jayanti in Belagavi on Monday. | Photo Credit: P.K. Badiger Bhakta Shrestha Kanaka Dasa Jayanti was celebrated across districts on Monday. In Belagavi and Vijayapura districts, colourful processions were taken out in the morning. Folk artists performed Dollu Kunita and folk dances along the way. Artists dressed up as Kanaka Dasa sang his Bhakti songs. MLA Asif (Raju) Sait, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Roshan, Police Commissioner Iada Martin Marbaniang, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Rahul Shinde and other officers were present during the inauguration of the procession. A public function was held in the Kumara Gandharva Kala Mandir in Belagavi jointly by the district administration, the Belagavi City Corporation and the Department of Kannada and Culture. Deputy Commissioner of the City Corporation Uday Kumar, who inaugurated the celebrations, spoke on the life and contribution of the saint-poet. He said that the contribution of Kanaka Dasa through his spiritual songs and prose writings contributed greatly to the whole quantum of India’s Dasa Sahitya. “However, we should not just read them, wonder at them and then forget them. It is our responsibility to adopt them in our daily life. We have to realise that through his Bhakti literature, Kanaka Dasa gave us important lessons in social equality and stress arising out of daily life. It is a matter of pride for us that he was born in this State and wrote in Kannada. It is our responsibility to preserve and protect his literature and legacy,” he said. Sri Siddayogi Amareswara Appaji said that the term Bhakti has positive connotations and did not mean servitude. “It means surrendering ourselves to our own soul,” he said. “Kanaka Dasa tried to create awareness through his Keerthanas and worked hard to fight the caste system in society in the 15th-16th centuries. He played an active role in spreading the message of equality and uplifting community. He gained popularity through his simple writings and compositions, showing his innovation using the everyday activities of the common man through his literary writings. That is why he remains relevant even today. May his teachings guide us towards a harmonious and compassionate existence,” the seer said. The seer related the story of how Kanaka Nayaka, a war leader, turned to asceticism after a war. “He became one of the strong pillars of Hari Dasa literature in Kannada,” the seer added. Retired police officer Ashoka Sadalagi, Deputy Director of Kannada and Culture Department Vidyawati Bhanjatri, the former Mayor Yallappa Kuruba, community leaders like Prakash Pujeri, Rekha Dalwai, S.T. Sabannavara, Pratap Kumar and others were present. Karnataka Bala Vikas Academy chairman Sangameshwar Babaleshwar spoke at an event organised in Kandagal Hanumantaraya Hall in Vijayapura. He said that the lessons of equality, non-discrimination, purification of the soul and social service given by Kanaka Dasa are for all mankind and for all times to come. “Kanaka Dasa was among the saints who helped us open our inner eyes of wisdom. He taught us to respect others irrespective of their social or economic standing,” he said. He said that the Bal Vikas Academy will organise competitions to spread the ideas of Kanaka Dasa for school and college children. ZP CEO Rishi Ananda said that Kanaka Dasa, who was a disciple of Vyasa Tirtha, was among the most important social reformers who adopted the Bhakti movement. Kanaka Dasa has not only dedicated various genres of literature like Kirtanas, Suladis, Ugabhogas to the world of Kannada literature but also made his own contribution to the world of music. Kanaka Dasa composed more than 300 hymns. He created many works, including Haribhaktisara, Mohana Tarangini, Ramdhanyacharita, Nalacharita, Mr. Anand said. Resource person A.H. Kolamali described Kanaka Dasa as the voice of the deprived. He was a genius who challenged prejudices and social evils through his writings. He gave us the gift of knowledge and wisdom. Today’s young generation should adopt these principles, he said. Community leaders leaders Mallanna Shirasyad, Siddarama Biradar, Ramaswamy Kolamali, S.C. Kurle, Mahesh Pujari and Assistant Director of Department of Kannada and Culture Santosh Bhovi attended the event. Additional Police Commissioner Shankar Marihal, Additional Deputy Commissioner Somalinga Gennoor and others were present.

Bangladesh will seek extradition of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina from India: Interim chief Yunus,"Updated - November 18, 2024 08:08 am IST - Dhaka, Bangladesh Chief Adviser Prof. Muhammad Yunus said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Ms. Hasina was in power, would be investigated. File | Photo Credit: Getty Images Bangladesh’s interim leader and Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus said Sunday (November 17, 2024) that his administration will seek the extradition of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from India, where she has been in exile since fleeing a mass uprising in August 2024. In a televised address to the nation on his first 100 days in office, Mr. Yunus said that the interim government will try those responsible, including Ms. Hasina, for hundreds of deaths during the student-led uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Mr. Yunus took the helm on August 8, 2024, three days after Ms. Hasina fled the country. He said that not only the deaths in the uprising but all other violations of human rights, including alleged enforced disappearances while Ms. Hasina was in power, would be investigated. Bangladesh has sought help from the global police organization Interpol in issuing a red notice for the arrest of Ms. Hasina and her associates. “We will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,” Mr. Yunus said. “I have already discussed the issue with chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.” Bangladesh asks Interpol for help in arresting ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Bangladesh's tribunal summons ex-Army Chief, 10 former Ministers and Advisers to Former PM Sheikh Hasina over alleged genocide International Crimes Tribunal, estbalished by Sheikh Hasina, issues arrest warrants against her, 45 others While Hasina and her close associates are facing numerous criminal charges at home, the Yunus-led government is also pushing for the ICC to take up the case. Seeking Hasina's extradition could also pose a challenge for India, which has treated her as a trusted friend. Mr. Yunus said his government's most important task was to hold a new election to hand over power to an elected government, but he did not spell out any timeframe. He said his administration would first bring about reforms in various sectors, including in the electoral system. He promised that once the electoral reforms are completed, a roadmap for the new election would be unveiled. Mr. Yunus has been talking to political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina's Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. Mr. Yunus said the Election Commission will be reconstituted soon. “But as we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work. The train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties,” he said. Mr. Yunus also downplayed as “exaggerated"" reports of attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, many of whom complained that hard-line Islamists are becoming increasingly influential since Hasina’s ouster.

"Salabhakoodu, a haven for children on the Thiruvananthapuram district court campus","Updated - November 18, 2024 05:22 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram Counselling being given to children at Salabhakoodu, a child-friendly space established at the District Legal Services Authority on the Vanchiyoor court premises. On Saturday, as a woman litigant waited to be heard at the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) on the district court premises at Vanchiyoor in the city, she brought her restive toddler into Salabhakoodu, a child-friendly space on the first floor of the court complex. The child spent many happy minutes there, even as the mother was spared a tantrum. Later, an older child arrived there for counselling along with her parents. Once counselling was over, the girl played with toys and explored the games, books, and aquarium that make Salabhakoodu a space that children feel comfortable in. Facilitated by the Sakhi Women’s Resource Centre and supported by the Technopark-based RM India, Salabhakoodu was set up by the DLSA in April this year to provide assistance to children involved in legal proceedings or those in need of support such as counselling. Children accompanying adults involved in litigation or those reaching the DLSA for legal services also come to Salabhakoodu. The one-of-its-kind initiative is part of the attempts to establish child support centres in all DLSAs under the Kerala Legal Services Authority’s Child Legal Assistance Programme (CLAP), says J. Sandhya, lawyer and secretary of the Sakhi Women’s Resource Centre. Salabhakoodu functions from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Saturday (except second Saturday). It is staffed by child psychologist Megha P. and social worker S. Ramanand. When needed, children and parents together are given counselling here. Every Saturday, parents who have been given visitation rights by the family court to meet their children on the basis of a guardian-ward petition can do so at Salabhakoodu in the presence of the two staff members. At present, around eight families utilise this space for interaction. CLAP panel lawyers also use the facility to meet children so as to hear their independent points of view. Salabhakoodu has a video conferencing system to enable children to give statements without physically going to the court. The Salabhakoodu staff also suo motu inquire into reports of violation of child rights that appear in the media and initiate action on directions from the DLSA secretary. For instance, they had conducted an inquiry and pre-litigation hearing into the closure of a city Corporation nursery school at Beemapally, and in the case of wild animal attacks at Government Upper Primary School, Ponmudi. Other cases it has intervened in include the recent disappearance of an Assamese girl from the city and administration of wrong injection to a child at a hospital here. So far, 40 beneficiaries have made use of the facilities at Salabhakoodu. DLSA secretary Shamnad S. who has overall charge of Salabhakoodu says it is an exclusive space where mental, emotional, and other requirements of children, whether in need of care and protection or in conflict with law, can be addressed. “The best interests of the children are ensured here. Salabhakoodu also supports survivors in Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) cases to get victim compensation,” Mr. Shamnad said.

Centre to exceed FY25 direct tax collection target: CBDT chief,"Advertisement NEW DELHI: The government will exceed the Rs 22.07 lakh crore direct tax collection target set for the current fiscal, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Ravi Agarwal said on Monday. Agarwal also said that taxpayers who have not disclosed their foreign income or assets in their ITRs have time till December 31 to file their revised return for the 2023-24 fiscal. The tax department is in the process of sending SMS and emails to those assessees who have not disclosed high-value assets. Inaugurating the Taxpayers Lounge at the India International Trade Fair (IITF), Agarwal also said that more than 6,000 suggestions have come in for a review of the income tax law to make the language simple and easy to understand. ""We are hopeful and we believe that we will exceed the budget target for tax collection. Collections from corporate and non-corporate taxes have risen,"" Agarwal told reporters here. As per the latest data released by the CBDT, between April 1 and November 10, net direct tax collection has grown 15.41 per cent to Rs 12.11 lakh crore. This includes net corporate tax of Rs 5.10 lakh crore and non-corporate taxes (including taxes paid by individuals, HUFs, firms) of Rs 6.62 lakh crore. Securities transaction tax (STT) worth Rs 35,923 crore was mopped up during the period. The government has set a target to collect Rs 22.07 lakh crore from direct taxes during the current fiscal. This includes Rs 10.20 lakh crore from corporate tax and Rs 11.87 lakh crore from personal income tax, corporate tax and other taxes. With regard to notifying taxpayers for non-disclosure of foreign assets, Agarwal said the tax department gets all details about foreign assets from nations under the automatic exchange of information and match such details with the disclosures in the ITRs. ""The basic intent is to remind taxpayers to declare the foreign assets. They can file revised return by December 31,"" he said. Foreign assets include foreign bank accounts, foreign cash value insurance, financial interest in any business/entity, immovable property outside India, foreign equity or debit interest, accounts in which an assessee has signing authority, and any other capital assets. When asked about the progress in income tax law review, the CBDT chief said that public consultation is ongoing and more than 6,000 suggestions have been received by the department. ""I would invite taxpayers to come forward and give suggestions on international best practice, statute,"" he added. Last month, the CBDT's internal committee invited public inputs for review of the six-decade-old I-T Act with regard to simplification of language, litigation reduction, compliance reduction, and obsolete provisions. The CBDT has set up 22 specialised sub-committees to review various aspects of the Act. Pursuant to the Budget announcement by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the CBDT had set up an internal committee to oversee the review and make the Act concise, clear, and easy to understand, which will reduce disputes, litigation, and provide greater tax certainty to taxpayers.

Manipur Violence Sparks Mass Resignation Among BJP Leaders; 1 Killed In Jiribam Protests,"As the violence continued to shake Manipur on Monday, several BJP office bearers from the Jiribam district submitted their resignation, citing the “unwelcome"" condition of the state in a letter to the high command. However, the BJP state office clarified that they have not yet received any resignation letters from the BJP committee of Jiribam Mandal. The leaders signed a joint letter of resignation, addressed to Manipur BJP chief Sharda Devi. The development comes in the wake of heightened tensions following the deaths of six Meitei civilians who were abducted by Kuki militants on November 11 and later found dead. A protestor was killed and another sustained injuries on Sunday as protests and violence continued in Manipur’s valley areas, the police said on Monday. It comes after security forces opened fire in Jiribam district to disperse the mob, killing a 20-year-old man identified as K Athouba, said police, adding that the incident took place around 11 pm at Babupara. The mob reportedly ransacked and set fire to the local offices of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in the Jiribam area, prompting the security forces to resort to firing to bring the law and order situation under control. In a separate incident, an angry mob set fire to the residence of Public Works Department (PWD) and Youth Affairs and Sports (YAS) Minister Govindas Konthoujam. The attack, involving an estimated 300 to 400 protesters, caused extensive damage to the property, with losses pegged at approximately Rs 3 crore. Nearly 80 per cent of the house was destroyed in the blaze, and the minister’s office, located within the premises, was also completely burned. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the security situation in Manipur on Monday and directed the MHA officials to take all possible steps to ensure peace in the Northeastern state.

"Alleged delay in providing landslide relief-UDF, LDF hartal today in Wayanad","Updated - November 18, 2024 08:14 pm IST - KALPETTA The United Democratic Front (UDF) district committee has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Wayanad on Tuesday (November 19, 2024) in protest against the alleged delay by the Central government in providing special assistance to Kerala for the rehabilitation of landslide-affected areas in the district. In a statement, the UDF district committee said that the hartal also aims at condemning the Centre’s failure to categorise the Chooralmala-Mundakkai landslides as a national disaster, as well as the State government’s purported delay in offering necessary aid to the affected residents. However, essential services, including media operations, dairy supply, and healthcare services, will remain exempt from the hartal. Marches will be taken out at 10 a.m. at Assembly constituency headquarters in Mananthavady, Sultan Bathery, and Kalpetta as a part of it. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) has also announced its hartal in the district on the same day, highlighting the Centre’s neglect of landslide survivors.

Virtues among political leaders have become scarce and dear during their public speeches: Karnataka High Court,"Published - November 18, 2024 08:51 pm IST - Bengaluru Virtues like maintaining decency, decorum, and responsible use of language by political leaders in public speeches have become scarce and dear these days, observed the High Court of Karnataka. “As a Constitutional Court, this court could only expect and hope that responsible use of language would be employed by the leaders in their public speeches and all dispensations,” observed a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice N.V. Anjaria and Justice K.V. Aravind, while dismissing with a cost of ₹25,000 a PIL petition, filed by All India Dalit Action Committee, Bengaluru. The petitioner had sought a direction to the authorities from the court to take action against Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi for throwing to the winds the norms of decency by allegedly making statements adverse to the modesty of women in his speech at a rally in Shivamogga during campaigning of Lok Sabha polls. It was alleged in the petition that Mr. Gandhi had defamed a certain section of women while speaking about the episode of former MP Prajwal Revanna’s rape cases and obscene videos. The petitioner pointed out that Mr. Gandhi had breached several provisions of the law apart from violating the election model code of conduct. Without going into the merits or demits of alleged statements referred in the petition, the Bench said that this issue does not come under the purview of PIL petition when other recourses and remedies are available to the petitioner in relation to the alleged statements. Leaving open to the petitioner to take appropriate recourse, the Bench said that it is not for the court to assess and opine about public utterances, which may be made by political leaders in course of their public speeches or during the election canvass. The Bench imposed the cost on the petitioner for filing misconceived petition as a PIL and wasting judicial time.

Punjab farmers to resume ‘Delhi Chalo’ march on December 6,"Updated - November 18, 2024 06:20 pm IST - CHANDIGARH Farmers are on the streets ruing the primary issue of concern for them — there is still no law enacted on MSP, with the Centre turning a blind eye to their other demands, despite repeated appeals. Representational file image. | Photo Credit: PTI Farmers and farm labourers groups, camping on the inter-State boundaries of Punjab and Haryana since February this year, on Monday (November 18, 2024) announced they would resume their ‘tractor-trolley Delhi Chalo’ march to lay siege to the national capital on December 6. Groups of farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) — the two umbrella bodies that are spearheading the farmers’ agitation in Punjab — have been, since February 13, camping at Shambhu-Ambala and Khanauri-Jind, the inter-State boundaries between Haryana and Punjab, after being stopped from entering Haryana. They had then given the call for the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march to press for the fulfilment of their demands, including the key demands of a legal guarantee for the purchase of crops at a Minimum Support Price (MSP), and farm loan waivers. Also read | Farmers at the bottom of the food chain Addressing a press conference here, KMM coordinator Sarwan Singh Pandher said the farmers’ movement had been going on since February, but the Central government was not paying any heed to the demands. “We have decided to resume our ‘Delhi Chalo’ march on December 6. Also, from November 26, farmers will start a fast unto death. Farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal will observe the fast,” Mr. Pandher said. Since the farmers’ protest began, multiple rounds of meetings were held between the Central government and farmer leaders before the Lok Sabha election, but this did not result in anything concrete. Farmers are on the streets ruing the primary issue of concern for them — there is still no law enacted on MSP, with the Centre turning a blind eye to their other demands, despite repeated appeals. Their other demands include complete debt waiver for farmers and farm labourers; a monthly pension for farmers and farm labourers upon reaching the age of 58; withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill, 2020; reintroduction of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 to ensure farmers’ consent and compensation at four times the rate set by the Collector; withdrawal from the World Trade Organization and banning all Free Trade Agreements; 200 days of employment annually at a daily wage of ₹700 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act; protection of land, forests and water sources belonging to tribal communities; cancellation of cases filed against farmers during the year-long (2020-21) protest on Delhi’s borders, and compensation for the families of farmers who died during the protest; and punishment to the guilty in the Lakhimpur Kheri killing case, among others.

Rajasthan Vidyut Nigam reiterates doubts about Chhattisgarh ST Commission’s findings on Parsa mine clearances,"Updated - November 18, 2024 10:04 pm IST - NEW DELHI Parsa East Kente Basan (PEKB) coal mine in Surguja district of Chhattisgarh. | Photo Credit: AFP Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL) has once again questioned the legitimacy of a report by the Chhattisgarh State Scheduled Tribes Commission, which found irregularities in environmental clearances for the Parsa coal mine in the State’s Surguja region. “In 2023, CSSTC, under the same leadership, set aside the matter following a thorough investigation by the district administration of Surguja,” RRVUNL said. This comes after news reports on the Commission’s findings and its recommendation to cancel forest clearances for the mining project in the biodiversity-rich area. The Commission said it had found the clearances for the Parsa mine project to have been obtained by using forged documents with respect to the consent of the gram sabha. To this, RRVUNL said: “The issue of Gram Sabha’s approval is pending adjudication, and none of the courts have yet passed any adverse observation on the aspect of alleged irregularity in the permissions.” The Parsa coal mine has been allotted to RRVUNL, which has subsequently selected Adani Group as the mine developer and operator for the project that has long been opposed by activists and a certain section of locals in the region. In a clarification, RRVUNL questioned the legitimacy of the Commission’s report, saying that the absence of the Secretary’s signature on it made it a “flawed document”. The document was, however, signed by the Commission’s chairperson, Bhanu Pratap Singh and two other Members, according to The Hindu’s report, which had also detailed RRVUNL’s doubts on the legitimacy of the documents. RRVUNL further said the “unsubstantiated document cites the inputs of only a small group of individuals while this matter pertains to thousands of local stakeholders and RVUN”.

"Chandrababu Naidu is not sincere about SC categorisation, says former Minister","Published - November 18, 2024 06:26 pm IST - VIJAYAWADA YSRCP leader Adimulapu Suresh | Photo Credit: File photo The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) lashed out at Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for “resorting to cheap political tactics” and creating a wedge between Scheduled Caste (SC) communities under the pretext of ‘categorisation’. Addressing a press conference at the YSRCP office at Tadepalli on Monday, YSRCP leader and former Minister Adimulapu Suresh alleged that Mr. Naidu is not sincere about the SC categorisation issue. “Though Mr. Naidu was in an alliance with the ruling party at the Centre on earlier occasions too, such as in 1997, he never thought of enacting legislation that would benefit the sub-castes. Rather, he allowed the pot to keep boiling for three decades, only with the intention of getting political mileage,” he alleged. The Chief Minister has been using Manda Krishna Madiga as a tool for his selfish gains and to target YSRCP president and former Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Under the YSRCP rule from 2019 to 2024, the sub castes of the Scheduled Castes were given equal opportunities. The sub-castes were given prestigious posts during the YSRCP regime,” he claimed.  “Mr. Manda Krishna has been reading out a script prepared by the Chief Minister like a puppet. Instead of questioning Mr. Naidu why the categorisation was not done on a full scale at the Centre and State levels, Mr. Manda Krishna is levelling allegations against Mr. Jagan. Representatives of sub-castes were given prestigious posts in the Cabinet and in corporations among others, while Mr. Naidu has always been scheming to create a wedge between the SC communities,” he alleged. Former chairman of SC Corporation Kommuri Kanaka Rao also spoke.
